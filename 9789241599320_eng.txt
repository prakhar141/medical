Introduction

In 2007, the World Health Assembly passed a Resolution titled ‘Better Medicines for Children’. This 
resolution recognized the need for research and development into medicines for children,  including 
better dosage forms, better evidence and better information about how to ensure that medicines 
for treating the common childhood diseases are given at the right dose for children of all ages. The 
World Health Organization has therefore developed a program of work on medicines for children, 
including the development of a Model List of Essential Medicines for children (EMLc). As an extra 
resource for health-care workers and national programmes that supply medicines for children, this 
new edition of the WHO Model Formulary has been prepared, based on the 2nd edition of the 
EMLc, to provide prescribers with the best information about how to use the medicines included on 
the List. 

In developing the WHO Model Formulary for Children, the editors have based decisions on 
treatment regimens on the best available evidence from clinical studies in children, that have been 
assessed and evaluated by the WHO Expert Committee on Selection and Use of Essential Medicines. 
However, as has been found by all authorities in relation to medicines for children, in many cases the 
recommendations on dose and duration of treatment in children have to be extrapolated from studies 
in adults and adjusted based on our understanding of the effect of age and development on the 
absorption, distribution and metabolism and excretion of different medicines in children of different 
ages. One of the aims of this publication is therefore not only to describe what is known about 
treatments, but to highlight where more research is needed.

An electronic version of the WHO Formulary for Children is also available, intended as a starting 
point for developing institutional or national formularies. The text of the Formulary can be used by 
groups who wish to develop their own version, by adapting the text or by adding or deleting entries 
to align the formulary to their own list of essential medicines. 

This edition of the WHO Model Formulary is fully compatible with the 2nd List of Essential 
Medicines for Children, as recommended by the WHO Expert Committee on the Selection and Use 
of Essential Medicines in March 2009. Comments and suggestions are welcome and should be sent

Factors influencing paediatric drug therapy

Medicines in children 
It was once said that the moral test of government is how that government treats those who are in the 
dawn of life, the children; those who are in the twilight of life, the elderly; and those who are in the 
shadows of life—the sick, the needy and the handicapped.1

Children are among the most vulnerable individuals in any society. Nowhere is this more true than 
in their access to appropriate health care. As part of the treatment of children, health-care workers 
need access to drug dosage information. This formulary aims to provide that information universally, 
to assist in the management of children.

The use of medicines in infants and children presents a unique set of challenges to the prescriber. 
Physiological variances between children and adults, including the ontogeny of organ maturity and 
body composition, significantly influence the actions, effectiveness and safety of medicines. However, 
most pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic studies provide little, if any, information on drug 
action in infants and children, because they are usually conducted in adults.

Paediatric pharmacology developed initially from the extrapolation of therapeutic practice and 
experience in adults and the use of “scaled down” adult doses. This practice is clinically successful 
for the majority of drugs which are relatively non-toxic and have a wide margin between therapeutic 
and toxic doses. Drugs with a narrow therapeutic margin, such as the aminoglycoside antibiotics and 
digoxin, require more sophisticated knowledge and individualized dosage regimens. Doses of such 
agents are scaled by weight or allometrically (wt¾), then modified according to the results of serum 
drug concentration measurements, if these are available. Over the last two decades, there has been 
an increased recognition of the necessity to perform studies specifically in children and adolescents. 
Major national and international approaches, such as those of the European Union and the United 
States, have resulted in some new information to improve the use of medicines in children. 
This formulary is the result of the establishment of the WHO Model List of Essential Medicines for 
Children (EMLc). The list can be accessed at http://www.who.int/selection_medicines/en/.

Absorption
Oral absorption
The gastrointestinal tract, particularly the stomach, undergoes significant changes from birth until around 
3 years of age. Before then, the stomach has low levels of acid, and acid-labile drugs, such as the penicillins, 
show enhanced absorption. On the other hand, this depressed level of acidity may result in reduced 
absorption of weak acids such as phenobarbitone, phenytoin and rifampicin. The incomplete absorption 
experienced with these anticonvulsants may necessitate their continued parenteral administration.

The delayed gastric emptying seen in neonates and young infants is probably not as important as 
previously believed. In the first few weeks of life this may be significant, but most sick neonates 
receive their drugs parenterally.

viii	 WHO Model Formulary for Children 2010



Of considerable importance, particularly to the general public, is the question of drug administration 
and absorption relative to meals. Current evidence suggests that, with the exception of isoniazid, 
captopril, rifampicin, phenoxymethylpenicillin and tetracyclines (except doxycycline and 
minocycline), all medications should be administered with meals to avoid gastrointestinal irritation 
and to aid compliance.

Topical absorption
Topical absorption of drugs is enhanced in children and especially in infants. This is a direct result of 
the relative thinness of the stratum corneum. Absorption may be further enhanced in the presence of 
burnt or excoriated areas and with occlusive dressings. This has been well documented with the use 
of corticosteroid creams for eczema and nappy rash in infants, especially when the area treated has 
been occluded with plastic pants.

Rectal absorption
Rectal administration may be useful in patients who are vomiting and in infants and young children 
who are reluctant to take oral medication.

The rectal route is not ideal for all drugs. Considerable individual variation in rectal venous 
drainage, and hence in the extent of drug absorption, can produce either sub-therapeutic or toxic 
drug levels. Drugs with narrow therapeutic margins should not be administered rectally. One 
drug which is recommended for rectal administration in children is diazepam for the treatment of 
seizures. Paracetamol may also be administered rectally; however, the absorption may be erratic and 
therapeutic levels cannot be guaranteed.

Distribution
Numerous factors, including body composition, plasma–protein binding and the blood–brain barrier 
influence drug distribution in the various paediatric age groups.

Body composition
Total body water and fat composition alter significantly during the transition from birth to adult life. 
Total body water as a percentage of body weight is approximately 80% at birth, 65% at 12 months 
and 60% for a young adult male.

On the other hand, fat content as a percentage of body weight varies with age, being about 3% in 
premature infants, 12% in full-term neonates, 30% at 1 year of age and about 18% in the average 
adult.

Therefore, larger mg/kg body weight doses of water-soluble drugs need to be given to neonates and 
infants to achieve plasma concentrations similar to those seen in adults. However, this has to be 
balanced against diminished hepatic function and renal elimination before arriving at a final dosage 
recommendation.

WHO Model Formulary for Children 2010	 ix



Plasma protein binding
Drug–protein binding is diminished in neonates due to a lower concentration of plasma proteins, 
particularly albumin, and the lower drug-binding capacity of fetal albumin. This may lead to an 
increase in the fraction of unbound, pharmacologically active drug in the plasma. There may also be 
competition between endogenous substances, especially free fatty acids and bilirubin, and drugs for 
albumin-binding sites.

However, when drugs administered to neonates are examined in detail, very few highly protein-
bound drugs are used. From a practical point of view, highly protein-bound drugs such as 
phenytoin, sulfonamides, salicylates and diazepam should be given with caution in the presence of 
hyperbilirubinaemia.

In older children, there are several disease states which may affect drug–protein binding, including 
hepatic disease, nephrotic syndrome, chronic renal failure, cardiac failure and malnutrition.

Blood–brain barrier
The blood–brain barrier is a permeability barrier between the circulation and the brain cells bathed 
in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). The blood–brain barrier is functionally incomplete in the neonate, and 
certain substances show increased penetration into the brain. One of the most important factors 
which determine the rate of transport of drugs across the blood–brain barrier is their lipid solubility. 
This gives rise to increased brain uptake of barbiturates and morphine in infants.

As meningitis is a relatively common problem in paediatric practice, the extent to which 
antimicrobial agents penetrate the CSF is an important consideration. Although some agents 
penetrate poorly under normal circumstances, in the presence of meningeal inflammation, 
penetration may be considerably enhanced, so that adequate CSF drug concentrations are attained. 
Drugs in this category include penicillins, cefalosporins, rifampicin and vancomycin. Drugs which 
penetrate well even in the absence of meningeal inflammation include chloramphenicol and the 
combination sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim.

Although the aminoglycosides continue to be used for meningitis caused by Gram-negative 
organisms, the CSF concentrations achieved are generally low and inconsistent. Higher 
concentrations can be obtained by direct intrathecal or intraventricular injections, but controversy 
exists over the efficacy of such routes of administration. The newer cefalosporins, such as cefotaxime, 
appear to be more appropriate agents in most cases.

Metabolism
The various metabolic reactions that occur in the mature liver are not fully developed at birth. 
Cardiac insufficiency and respiratory distress may also contribute to decreased metabolic activity. 
Lidocaine, phenobarbital, phenytoin and diazepam show decreased metabolism in the neonate, 
resulting in increased drug half-lives.

During the first 15 days of life in premature and full-term babies, decreased metabolism is evident, 
but this is followed by a dramatic increase. Between 1 and 10 years of age, hepatic microsomal 

x	 WHO Model Formulary for Children 2010



oxidation is more rapid than in adults. Therefore phenobarbital, phenytoin and theophylline have 
shorter half-lives in children than in adults. This more rapid metabolism is almost certainly due 
to the fact that, during childhood, the liver is larger relative to body weight than in adult life. 
Allometric scaling may give a better prediction of the metabolic activity of the liver.

Excretion
Renal function is significantly less developed in premature and full-term neonates than it is in 
children and adults. Adult values for glomerular filtration rate are reached after about 3 to 6 months 
of age, while tubular function does not mature fully until after this.

Renal function is of particular importance to drug disposition in the neonatal period. Most sick 
neonates receive antibiotics for suspected or proven infection, and most of these agents are water 
soluble. In general, the lower the gestational age of the infant, the more prolonged the half-life will 
be in this period. The rate of elimination increases rapidly during the ensuing weeks, so that half-lives 
similar to those seen in adults are usually achieved by the end of the first month.

The WHO Model Formulary for Children
The hope is that this Formulary improves therapies in children by offering the best dosing 
information for those medicines currently listed on the EMLc. The Formulary is not, however, a 
substitute for the appropriate use of treatment guidelines, and should be used in conjunction with 
guidelines such as the WHO Pocket Book of Hospital Care for Children.

How to use the WHO Model Formulary for Children
Medication monographs are listed by section according to the WHO Model List of Essential 
Medicines for Children March 2009. Omission of a particular medication does not necessarily 
indicate that it is not available or recommended in children; merely that it is not considered an 
essential medicine for children by WHO. Medicines and dosage forms are listed in alphabetical order 
within each section and there is no implication of preference for one form over another. Standard 
treatment guidelines should be consulted for information on appropriate dosage forms.

The WHO Model Formulary for Children classifies children by age and doses medicines accordingly, 
most often in mg/kg. The Formulary is intended for use for children up to 12 years of age. 

Definition of age ranges
Neonate: 0–28 days 
Infant 1–12 months 
Child 1–12 years

If a maximum dose is listed this provides an indication of the upper dose limit when dosing 
paediatrics per kilogram.

Allowances must be made when using weight as a basis for dosing in oedematous or obese children. 
In such children the ideal weight for height and age should be used. In many cases, progressive dose 
adjustments may be required according to the patient’s response.

Doses based on surface area are quoted for some drugs. Surface area is calculated by the following equation:

Body surface area

(m2) = Ht (cm) x Wt (kg)

1.1      General anaesthetics and oxygen
To produce a state of prolonged full surgical anaesthesia reliably and safely, careful administration of 
a variety of drugs and close monitoring of the patient are required. Anaesthesia should be undertaken 
by non-specialist personnel only as a last resort, because anaesthetic drugs may be fatal if inappro-
priately used. Irrespective of the type of anaesthesia used (i.e. general or regional), it is essential that 
facilities for intubation and mechanically assisted ventilation are available.
Anaesthesia may be induced and maintained with intravenous medications and/or inhalation of a 
volatile agent (section 1.1). A range of other drugs including local anaesthetics (section 1.2), pre- 
operative medications (section 1.3), opioid analgesics (section 2.2), muscle relaxants and reversal 
agents (e.g. cholinesterase inhibitors; section 20) may also be required.
Oxygen should be added routinely during anaesthesia with inhalation agents, even when air is used 
as the carrier, to protect against hypoxia.

Halothane
ATC code: N01AB01

Inhalation
Special Notes: This medicine is listed as a representative of its pharmacological class. Other 

medicines in the same class may have similar clinical performance and may be selected for local 
formularies based on availability and price. The information in this monograph only applies to the 
medicine listed here.

Indications: Induction and maintenance of anaesthesia.
Contraindications: History of unexplained jaundice or fever following previous exposure to 

halothane; family history of malignant hyperthermia; raised cerebrospinal fluid pressure; 
porphyria.

Precautions: Anaesthetic history should be carefully taken to determine previous exposure and 
previous reactions to halothane (fulminant hepatic failure is a rare complication of re-exposure to 
halothane); avoid use if adequate resuscitation facilities are not available.

Dose:
Induction of anaesthesia.  

Inhalation through specifically calibrated vaporizer:  
Infant or Child initially 0.5% then gradually increase inspired gas concentration to 1.5–2% in 
oxygen or nitrous oxide-oxygen.

Maintenance of anaesthesia.  
Inhalation through specifically calibrated vaporizer:  
Infant or Child 0.5–2% in oxygen or nitrous oxide-oxygen.

Hepatic impairment: Avoid if history of unexplained pyrexia or jaundice following previous exposure 
to halothane.

Adverse effects: Common Bradycardia, respiratory depression.
Uncommon Arrhythmias, hepatitis (may be fatal).

Oxygen
ATC code: V03AN01

Inhalation (medicinal gas)

Fire hazard. Avoid use of cautery when oxygen is used with ether; reducing valves on oxygen 
cylinders must not be greased (risk of explosion).

Special Notes: Inhalation gas.
Indications: Maintain adequate tissue oxygenation in inhalational anaesthesia and other indications 

for use in neonates and children. Used during resuscitation and in the treatment of respiratory 
problems requiring supplemental oxygen.

Dose:
Concentration of oxygen in inspired anaesthetic gases should never be less than 21%, and 

preferably 30% or above.
The concentration required depends on the condition being treated.

Renal impairment: No dosage adjustment necessary.
Hepatic impairment: No dosage adjustment necessary.
Adverse effects: Long-term use of concentrations greater than 80% have a toxic effect on the lungs 

leading to pulmonary congestion, exudation and atelectasis. Short-term use of 100% is not 
associated with these toxic effects.

The concentration required depends on the condition being treated; if available, monitoring of the 
oxygen delivered is strongly recommended, as inappropriate concentration may have serious or 
even lethal effects. Risks include morbidity, brain damage, and especially in pre-term neonates can 
cause retinopathy with blindness and chronic lung disease.

Use of 100% oxygen should not be withheld in an emergency situation.
Interactions with other medicines (* indicates severe):
*	 Bleomycin: serious pulmonary toxicity in patients exposed to conventional oxygen concentrations 

during anaesthesia.
Notes: Monitoring of oxygen delivered is strongly recommended.
If available, use oxygen analyser to monitor inspired oxygen and pulse oximeter to monitor oxygen 

saturation.
Oxygen should be added routinely during anaesthesia with inhalational agents, even when air is used 

as the carrier gas, to protect against hypoxia.

Thiopental
ATC code: N01AF03

Powder for injection: 0.5 g; 1 g (sodium salt) in ampoule
Special Notes: Specialist skills required for administration and supportive management.
Indications: Induction of anaesthesia prior to administration of inhalational anaesthetic; anaesthesia 

of short duration.
Contraindications: Inability to maintain airway; hypersensitivity to barbiturates; severe 

cardiovascular disease; dyspnoea or obstructive respiratory disease; porphyria.

1.1      General anaesthetics and oxygen
Precautions: Asthma; hypotension; cardiovascular disease; myotonic dystrophy; reconstituted 

solution is highly alkaline: extravasation can result in extensive tissue necrosis and sloughing; intra-
arterial injection causes intense pain and may result in arteriospasm; rapid administration may 
result in severe hypotension and hiccups; renal impairment; hepatic impairment.

Skilled tasks Warn patient or carer about the risk of undertaking tasks requiring attention or coordination, 
for example riding a bike or operating machinery, for 24 hours.

Dose:
Titrate dose to effect.
Induction of anaesthesia, anaesthesia of short duration (< 15–20 minutes).  

Slow IV injection usually as a 2.5% (25 mg/ml) solution over 10–15 seconds:  
Neonate initially up to 2 mg/kg, then 1 mg/kg repeated as necessary (maximum total dose 
4 mg/kg).  
Infant or Child initially up to 5 mg/kg, then 1 mg/kg repeated as necessary (maximum total dose 
7 mg/kg).

Renal impairment: May need to reduce dose in severe impairment; administer slowly.
Hepatic impairment: Reduce dose for induction in severe liver disease.
Adverse effects: Common Hypotension, transient erythema, injection site reactions, 

cardiorespiratory depression, myocardial depression, prolonged somnolence and recovery, cough, 
sneezing, cardiac arrhythmias.

Uncommon Laryngospasm, rash, allergic reactions.
Rare Anaphylaxis, bronchospasm, haemolytic anaemia.
Interactions with other medicines (* indicates severe):
	 Amitriptyline: increased risk of arrhythmias and hypotension.
*	 Chlorpromazine: enhanced hypotensive effect.
	 Diazepam: enhanced sedative effect.
	 Enalapril: enhanced hypotensive effect.
*	 Fluphenazine: enhanced hypotensive effect.
	 Furosemide: enhanced hypotensive effect.
*	 Haloperidol: enhanced hypotensive effect.
	 Isoniazid: possible potentiation of isoniazid hepatotoxicity.
	 Silver sulfadiazine: enhanced effects of thiopental.
	 Spironolactone: enhanced hypotensive effect.
	 Sulfadiazine: enhanced effects of thiopental.
	 Sulfadoxine + pyrimethamine: enhanced effects of thiopental.
	 Sulfamethoxazole + trimethoprim: enhanced effects of thiopental.
	 Vancomycin: hypersensitivity-like reactions can occur with concomitant intravenous vancomycin.
*	 Verapamil: enhanced hypotensive effect and AV delay.
Notes: For intravenous injection, dilute to a concentration of 25 mg/ml with water for injection; give 

over at least 10–15 seconds.
Avoid rapid IV injection (may cause hypotension or decreased cardiac output).
Induction is rapid and excitement does not usually occur.
Thiopental does not have analgesic properties.
Monitoring for hypotension and respiratory compromise is required.
Lower doses are needed in shock and low cardiac output states.
Repeated doses have a cumulative effect especially in neonates where recovery is slower.

1.2      Local anaesthetics
Drugs used for conduction anaesthesia (also termed local or regional anaesthesia) reversibly block 
conduction along nerve fibres. Local anaesthetics have variable properties and a range of uses. These 
include topical (surface) anaesthesia, local anaesthesia and more specialized anaesthetic procedures 
requiring higher level technical skills (e.g. nerve blocks and regional, epidural and spinal anaesthesia).

Local anaesthetic toxicity
Local anaesthetic toxicity is usually due to excessively high plasma concentrations. Therefore, great 
care should be taken to avoid accidental intravascular injection or unwanted systemic absorption. 
Facilities for resuscitation should be available at all times. 
 

Bupivacaine
ATC code: N01BB01

Injection: 0.25%; 0.5% (hydrochloride) in vial
Injection for spinal anaesthesia: 0.5% (hydrochloride) in 4 ml ampoule to be mixed with 7.5%

Special Notes: Bupivacaine is a representative local anaesthetic. Various drugs can serve as 
alternatives.

This medicine is listed as a representative of its pharmacological class. Other medicines in the same 
class may have similar clinical performance and may be selected for local formularies based on 
availability and price. The information in this monograph only applies to the medicine listed here.

Indications: Infiltration anaesthesia; peripheral and sympathetic nerve block; spinal or epidural 
anaesthesia (except in dehydrated or hypovolaemic patients); post-operative analgesia.

Contraindications: Local inflammation or infection; septicaemia; intravenous regional anaesthesia 
(e.g. Bier’s block); use in intravenous infusions; spinal or epidural anaesthesia in patients taking 
anticoagulant therapy or with coagulation disorders; severe anaemia or heart disease; spinal or 
epidural anaesthesia in dehydrated or hypovolaemic patients; hypersensitivity to amide local 
anaesthetics.

1.3      Preoperative medication and sedation for short-term procedures

1.3      Preoperative medication and sedation for short-
term procedures

Appropriate premedication is an important consideration for procedures in children requiring 
conduction or general anaesthesia. Premedication may be used to help manage pain and anxiety and 
to improve the course of subsequent anaesthesia. A potent analgesic such as morphine (section 2.2) 
should be administered peri-operatively to patients in severe pain or for analgesia during and after 
surgery.

Atropine
ATC code: A03BA01

Injection: 1 mg (as sulfate) in 1 ml ampoule
Indications: Preoperative medication to inhibit salivation and secretions; reversal of the muscarinic 

effects of cholinergic agents such as neostigmine and pyridostigmine; treatment of bradycardia 
secondary to cholinergic stimulation.

Contraindications: Closed-angle glaucoma; myasthenia gravis; prostatic enlargement; severe 
gastrointestinal inflammatory disease; gastrointestinal obstruction.

Precautions: Down syndrome; children; ulcerative colitis; diarrhoea; heart failure; gastrointestinal 
disorders; hyperthyroidism; cardiac disorders; tachycardia; hypertension; hypoxia; fever and in 
warm environments (monitor temperature and keep patients cool); constipation; delirium.

Children Children are at increased risk for rapid rise in body temperature due to suppression of sweat gland 
activity. Large doses may cause paradoxical hyperexcitability.
Down syndrome Down syndrome children have both increased sensitivity to cardiac effects and mydriasis. 
Children with Down syndrome also have more secretions and may require atropine more frequently.

Dose:
Premedication.  

IV:   
Child all ages 20 micrograms/kg (max 600 micrograms) immediately before induction of 
anaesthesia. 
SC:   
Neonate 10–15 micrograms/kg 30–60 minutes before induction of anaesthesia. 
 Infant or Child 20 micrograms/kg (minimum dose 100 micrograms, maximum dose 
600 micrograms) 30–60 minutes before induction of anaesthesia. 
IM:   
Infant or Child 20 micrograms/kg (minimum dose 100 micrograms, maximum dose 
600 micrograms) 30–60 minutes before induction of anaesthesia.

Reversal of the muscarinic effects of cholinergic agents. 
IV:  
Neonate 20 micrograms/kg. 
Infant or Child 20 micrograms/kg (maximum dose 600 micrograms). 

Treatment of bradycardia secondary to cholinergic stimulation. 
IV:  
Neonate 20 micrograms/kg. 
Infant or Child 10–20 micrograms/kg (maximum dose 600 micrograms).

Renal impairment: Use with caution. No dose adjustment necessary.
Hepatic impairment: Use with caution. No dose adjustment necessary.

rash, difficulty in micturition, constipation, arrhythmias, tachycardia, palpitations, fever.
Uncommon Nausea, vomiting, confusion.
Rare Closed-angle glaucoma, seizures.
Interactions with other medicines (* indicates severe):
Note Many drugs have antimuscarinic effects; concomitant use of two or more such drugs can increase adverse 
effects such as dry mouth, urine retention and constipation.
	 Amitriptyline: increased antimuscarinic adverse effects.
	 Chlorphenamine: increased antimuscarinic adverse effects.
	 Chlorpromazine: increased antimuscarinic adverse effects (but reduced plasma chlorpromazine 

concentration).
	 Haloperidol: possibly reduced effects of haloperidol.
	 Metoclopramide: antagonism of effects of metoclopramide on gastrointestinal activity.
	 Neostigmine: antagonism of effects of neostigmine. Late unopposed bradycardia may result.
	 Pyridostigmine: antagonism of effects of pyridostigmine.
Notes: For IV administration, administer undiluted by rapid IV injection; slow injection may result 

in paradoxical bradycardia.

Pain management in children
In general terms, principles for drug management of pain in children follow the WHO Analgesic 
Ladder with the following recommendations for increasing pain:
•	 mild pain: non-opioid with or without non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medicine (NSAIM) and 

adjuvant
•	 moderate pain: mild opioid with non-opioid, NSAIM and adjuvant
•	 severe pain: strong opioid with non-opioid, NSAIM and adjuvant, with or without specialist 

techniques.
Non-drug strategies are also an important part of managing pain in children.

2.1      Non-opioids and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory 
medicines (NSAIMs)

Non-opioid analgesics include paracetamol and NSAIMs (section 2.1). These are particularly suitable 
for musculoskeletal pain. Combining a non-opioid with an opioid analgesic can provide more  
effective analgesia than either medication alone.

Ibuprofen
ATC code: M01AE01

Tablet: 200 mg; 400 mg
Special Notes: WHO age/weight restriction: > 3 months.
Indications: Mild to moderate pain.
Contraindications: Hypersensitivity (including asthma, angioedema, urticaria or rhinitis) to 

acetylsalicylic acid or any other NSAIM; active peptic ulceration or upper gastrointestinal 
bleeding; severe renal failure, hepatic failure or cardiac failure.

Precautions: Asthma; cardiac disease; volume depletion, such as in gastroenteritis or dehydration 
(increased risk of renal impairment); concomitant use of drugs that increase risk of bleeding; 
previous peptic ulceration; coagulation defects; allergic disorders; renal impairment; hepatic 
impairment.

Dose:
Mild to moderate pain.  

Oral:  
Infant or Child over 3 months 5–10 mg/kg three or four times daily with or after food. 
Maximum daily dose is 40 mg/kg/day.

2.2      Opioid analgesics
Opioid analgesics act on the central nervous system. Morphine is effective in relieving moderate 
to severe pain, particularly of visceral origin; there is a large variation in patient response. Weaker 
opioids such as codeine are suitable for mild to moderate pain.

Opioid analgesic overdose
In overdose, opioids can cause respiratory depression and coma with pinpoint pupils. Naloxone  
(section 4.2) is a specific antidote.

SECTION 3:
Antiallergics and medicines used in anaphylaxis

26	 WHO Model Formulary for Children 2010



3      Antiallergics and medicines used in anaphylaxis

3	 Antiallergics and medicines used in 
anaphylaxis

Allergic disorders are a common problem in children. Allergic conditions include asthma, eczema, 
urticaria, allergic rhinitis (hayfever) and allergies to foods, medicines and drugs.
Allergic reactions which are mild and of limited duration (e.g. urticaria and allergic rhinitis) may not 
require treatment. However, when symptoms are moderate or persistent, medications such as anti-
histamines and corticosteroids may be required.
Antihistamines inhibit the wheals, pruritus, sneezing and nasal secretory responses that characterize 
allergy, and thus relieve allergic symptoms.
Corticosteroids suppress or prevent almost all symptoms of inflammation associated with allergy. 
Steroids should be used for short-term suppression of inflammation, but long-term use of steroids 
should be avoided, due to the risk of significant side-effects.

Allergic emergencies
Severe allergic reactions such as anaphylaxis and angioedema are life-threatening emergencies. 
First-line treatment for these conditions is epinephrine with appropriate resuscitation. Use of other 
medications in these conditions is secondary.

Chlorphenamine
ATC code: R06AB04

Injection: 10 mg (hydrogen maleate) in 1 ml ampoule
Oral liquid: 2 mg/5 ml
Tablet: 4 mg (hydrogen maleate)

Special Notes: Also referred to as chlorpheniramine maleate.
WHO age/weight restriction: > 1 year.
This medicine is listed as a representative of its pharmacological class. Other medicines in the same 

class may have similar clinical performance and may be selected for local formularies based on 
availability and price. The information in this monograph only applies to the medicine listed here.

Indications: Allergic conditions including urticaria, angioedema, rhinitis, conjunctivitis and in 
pruritic skin disorders.

Intravenously as an adjunct in the emergency treatment of anaphylactic shock.
Contraindications: Hypersensitivity to chlorphenamine or dexchlorpheniramine.
Precautions: Asthma; bladder neck obstruction; hepatic insufficiency; narrow angle glaucoma; 

pyloroduodenal obstruction; sedative effects; stenosing peptic ulcer; symptomatic prostatic 
hypertrophy.

Skilled tasks Warn patient or carer about the risk of undertaking tasks requiring attention or coordination, 
for example riding a bike or operating machinery, for 24 hours.

4	 Antidotes and other substances used in 
poisonings

The following notes on treatment of poisoning are guidelines only. It is strongly recommended that 
poisons information centres or other local sources of expertise be consulted in cases of suspected 
poisoning.
A diagnosis of poisoning is based on history, including details of the poisoning agent, the amount 
ingested, the time of ingestion, and the results of investigations when appropriate. Symptoms and 
signs depend on the agent involved and therefore vary widely.
Check for burns in or around the mouth, or stridor (abnormal respiratory sounds suggesting  
laryngeal damage), due to ingestion of corrosives. Admit all children who have ingested iron, pesticides, 
paracetamol, aspirin, narcotics, antidepressant drugs, paraquat, lithium or warfarin; or who have 
taken modified-release or prolonged-release dose forms. Children who have ingested corrosives or 
petroleum products should not be sent home within 6 hours.

Supportive care
Few patients require active removal of the poison, and most are treated symptomatically with  
supportive care and monitoring of vital signs.

Decontamination
Depending on the substance involved and circumstances of poisoning, decontamination of the skin 
and eyes (with appropriate protection of staff and carers) should be undertaken. For inhaled poisons, 
removal from the source of poisoning, administration of oxygen and further airway support may be 
required.

Gastric decontamination
Gastric decontamination (removal of poisons from the stomach) is most effective within 1 hour of 
ingestion; after this time it is usually of little benefit. Administration of activated charcoal to prevent 
further absorption is the treatment of choice for gastric decontamination.
Gastric lavage is rarely required. Induction of emesis for treatment of poisoning is not recommended.

4.1      Non-specific

Charcoal, activated
ATC code: A07BA01

Powder
Indications: Reduction of absorption of poisons; active elimination of poisons.
Contraindications: Poisoning by hydrocarbons with high potential for harm if aspirated; poisoning 

by corrosive substances (may prevent visualization of lesions caused by poison); unprotected 
airway; gastrointestinal tract not intact; bowel obstruction.

Precautions: Drowsy or unconscious child (risk of aspiration (intubate before administration via 
nasogastric or gastric tube)); not effective for poisoning with alcohols, clofenotane (dicophane, 
dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT)), cyanides, malathion, and metal salts including iron and 
lithium.

36	 WHO Model Formulary for Children 2010



4.1      Non-specific

Dose:
Reduction of absorption of poisons. 

Oral:  
Neonate, Infant or Child 1 g/kg (maximum 50 g) as a single dose as soon as possible after 
ingestion of poison.

Active elimination of poisons. 
Oral:  
Neonate, Infant or Child 1 g/kg (maximum 50 g) every 4 hours. 

Renal impairment: Not absorbed; no dose adjustment necessary.
Hepatic impairment: Not absorbed; no dose adjustment necessary.
Adverse effects: Common Black stools, colicky abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, constipation or 

diarrhoea.
Rare Bowel obstruction, aspiration, pneumonitis.
Interactions with other medicines (* indicates severe):
There are no known interactions involving a significant change in effect or where it is recommended 

to avoid concomitant use.
Notes: Administer as soon as possible after ingestion if significant toxicity is anticipated, preferably 

within 1 hour for greatest effect.
Administration after 1 hour is only of any potential benefit in selected poisonings. Refer to specialist 

texts for advice.
The powder should be mixed with fluid such as soft drinks, fruit juice, fruit syrup or chocolate syrup 

to mask the taste and form a drinkable solution. Mix well immediately prior to ingestion.
Do not mix with milk or ice cream.
Child must drink slowly to reduce risk of vomiting.
Palatability is improved by chilling.
Drinking may be easier if mixture is covered or the child drinks with their eyes closed.
Unconscious patients in whom decontamination is indicated require intubation to protect their 

airway. Activated charcoal can be administered via an orogastric or nasogastric tube after aspiration 
of stomach contents. This route may also be used in conscious patients who refuse, or cannot take, 
oral charcoal.

Laxatives should not be used concurrently with repeat dose activated charcoal because of the risk of 
fluid and electrolyte disturbances.

5      Anticonvulsants/antiepileptics

5	 Anticonvulsants/antiepileptics
Guiding principles for drug treatment of epilepsy in children
The aim of drug treatment for epilepsy is to prevent the recurrence of seizures. Treatment of epilepsy 
in children should also include counselling of the patient and family, treatment of underlying causes 
where possible, avoidance of precipitating factors, and safety education.
Guiding principles for drug treatment include the following:
•	 Start with a low dose and increase gradually until seizures are controlled, the maximum dose is 

reached or there are significant side-effects.
•	 Aim for single drug therapy (approximately 70% of children will achieve seizure control on a 

single drug).
•	 Monitor plasma drug concentrations in some situations.
•	 Use combination therapy when single drug therapy has failed to control seizures.
•	 Avoid sudden cessation of medication, since this can precipitate uncontrolled seizures. If a drug 

fails to control seizures, it should be gradually substituted with another, and the first drug should 
be withdrawn only when the new regimen is mainly established.

Interactions
Anticonvulsant medication interactions are complex. It is important to check for potential interactions 
when making any changes to the medication schedule of a child on anticonvulsants.

Carbamazepine
ATC code: N03AF01

Oral liquid: 20 mg/ml
Tablet (chewable): 100 mg; 200 mg
Tablet (scored): 100 mg; 200 mg

The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has issued a warning that all patients who are 
taking, or starting, any antiepileptic should be monitored for changes in behaviour that could 
indicate the emergence, or worsening, of suicidal thoughts or behaviour or depression.
Rare but potentially fatal blood cell abnormalities (aplastic anaemia and agranulocytosis) have 
been reported in association with carbamazepine treatment. These mostly occur in the first 
3–4 months of treatment.
Stevens-Johnson syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis may occur.
Patients and/or carers should be told how to recognize possible blood disorders and severe skin 
conditions, and to seek medical attention should they occur.

Special Notes: May be referred to as CBZ.
Indications: Generalized tonic-clonic and partial seizures.
Contraindications: Atrioventricular conduction abnormalities; history of bone marrow depression; 

porphyria.
Precautions: Hepatic impairment; renal impairment; cardiac disease; skin reactions (see Adverse 

effects); history of blood disorders (monitor blood counts before and during treatment); glaucoma; 
avoid sudden withdrawal.

Blood or skin disorders Patients or their carers should be told how to recognize signs of blood or 
skin disorders and advised to seek immediate medical attention if symptoms such as sore throat, rash, mouth 
ulcers, bruising or bleeding develop. Leukopenia which is severe, progressive or associated with clinical symptoms 
requires withdrawal (if necessary under cover of suitable alternative).
Skilled tasks Warn patient or carer about the risk of undertaking tasks requiring attention or coordination, 
for example riding a bike or operating machinery, for 24 hours.

Dose:
Status epilepticus.  

IV:  
Neonate, Infant or Child 18 mg/kg as a loading dose, then 2.5–5 mg/kg twice daily. 

Generalized tonic-clonic seizures, partial seizures.  
Oral:  
Infant or Child initially 1.5–2.5 mg/kg twice daily, increased gradually according to clinical 
response and plasma phenytoin concentrations to 2.5–5 mg/kg twice daily. Usual maximum 
7.5 mg/kg or 300 mg daily. 

Therapeutic drug monitoring Therapeutic drug monitoring is required for optimum response 
and to avoid unnecessary toxicities. Therapeutic plasma phenytoin concentrations are reduced in the first 
3 months of life because of reduced protein binding.
Trough plasma concentration for optimum response: Neonate–3 months: 6–15 mg/litre (25–60 micromol/litre);
Child 3 months–12 years: 10–20 mg/litre (40–80 micromol/litre).

5      Anticonvulsants/antiepileptics
Renal impairment: No specific dose adjustment is necessary. However, serum phenytoin protein 

binding is altered in uraemia which can affect proper interpretation/evaluation of serum phenytoin 
concentrations. The fraction of unbound phenytoin increases as renal function decreases, partially 
explained by decreases in serum albumin. In these cases clinical outcomes should be considered 
before changing doses according to blood levels.

Hepatic impairment: Reduce dose to avoid toxicity.
Adverse effects: Common Gastric intolerance, sleeplessness, agitation, sedation, confusion, ataxia, 

nystagmus, diplopia, blurred vision, slurred speech, cerebellar/vestibular symptoms, behavioural 
disorders, impaired learning (dose related), gingival hypertrophy, acne, coarse facies, hirsutism, 
impaired cognition, increased seizure frequency, lymph node enlargement, vertigo, rash 
(discontinue; if mild, reintroduce cautiously but discontinue if recurrence).

5	 Anticonvulsants/antiepileptics
Precautions: Monitor liver function before and during first 6 months of therapy, especially in 

patients at most risk (children under 3 years of age, those with metabolic disorders, degenerative 
disorders, organic brain disease or severe seizure disorders associated with mental retardation, 
or multiple antiepileptic therapy); ensure no undue potential for bleeding before starting and 
before major surgery or anticoagulant therapy; renal impairment; hepatic impairment; systemic 
lupus erythematosus; false-positive urine tests for ketones; avoid sudden withdrawal, unless under 
medical supervision.

Blood or hepatic disorders Patients or their carers should be told how to recognize signs of blood 
or liver disorders, and advised to seek immediate medical attention if symptoms including loss of seizure control, 
malaise, weakness, anorexia, lethargy, oedema, vomiting, abdominal pain, drowsiness, jaundice, or spontaneous 
bruising or bleeding develop.
Pancreatitis Patients or their carers should be told how to recognize signs of pancreatitis and advised to seek 
immediate medical attention if symptoms such as abdominal pain, nausea and vomiting develop; discontinue 
sodium valproate if pancreatitis diagnosed.
Skilled tasks Warn patient or carer about the risk of undertaking tasks requiring attention or coordination, 
for example riding a bike or operating machinery.

Dose:
All forms of epilepsy and seizure disorders including infantile spasms.  

Oral:

	 Zidovudine: plasma concentration of zidovudine possibly increased (risk of toxicity).
Notes: Plasma concentrations in therapeutic range of 40–100 mg/litre (280–700 micromol/litre); 

not generally considered useful in assessing control, but higher levels associated with increased 
incidence of adverse effects; low or undetectable plasma levels are not necessarily an indicator 
of non-adherence. In patients with confirmed adherence, dose change or co-medication may be 
needed.

6.1      Anthelminthics
Niclosamide is effective but may cause disintegration of T. solium segments and release viable eggs 

with subsequent cysticercosis (disease secondary to cysticercus encystment of larvae of T. solium in 
tissues and CNS). Concomitant laxative use 2 hours after niclosamide, although only specifically 
indicated for T. solium infections, is widely recommended, as the precise species of worm may not 
be confirmed.

WHO Model Formulary for Children 2010	 69



6	 Anti-infective medicines
Adverse effects: Usually mild and transitory with short courses. Many adverse effects result from 

death of the parasite and are more severe with a high parasite burden.
Symptoms such as papilloedema, retinal haemorrhages, focal seizures and motor weakness may occur 

in people with neurocysticercosis (due to an intense inflammatory response to dying larvae in 
CNS).

Others such as skin reactions, eosinophilia and fever are also thought to be responses to antigens 
released from dying parasites.

Common Dizziness (dose dependent), headache, malaise, drowsiness, nausea, vomiting, abdominal 
discomfort (dose dependent), diarrhoea, rectal bleeding, anorexia, colic, reversible rises in hepatic 
aminotransferases, pruritus, rash.

Rare Hypersensitivity reactions including fever, eosinophilia (may be due to dead and dying 
parasites), arrhythmia.

Interactions with other medicines (* indicates severe):
	 Albendazole: increased plasma concentration of active metabolite of albendazole.
*	 Carbamazepine: may significantly decrease praziquantel serum concentration.
	 Chloroquine: plasma praziquantel concentration possibly reduced.
*	 Dexamethasone: plasma praziquantel concentration reduced.
*	 Efavirenz: may significantly decrease praziquantel serum concentration.
	 Erythromycin: may increase praziquantel serum concentrations.
*	 Nevirapine: may significantly decrease praziquantel serum concentration.
*	 Phenobarbital: may significantly decrease praziquantel serum concentration.
*	 Phenytoin: plasma praziquantel concentration reduced.
*	 Rifampicin: increases metabolism of praziquantel and may reduce its concentration to ineffective 

levels.
	 Ritonavir: may increase praziquantel serum concentrations.
Notes: If the tablets or parts of the tablets are kept in the mouth, a bitter taste (which can promote 

gagging or vomiting) may be experienced.
Swallow whole (unchewed) and take with water during meals. Tablet may be cut into halves or 

quarters, but do not chew.

6	 Anti-infective medicines

6.1.2	 Antifilarials
Loiasis
Loiasis is an infection with the filarial nematode Loa loa, and is transmitted by the biting tabanid fly 
Chrysops. Most infections remain asymptomatic, although the classical migration of the adult worm 
may be seen across the eye.

Lymphatic filariasis
Lymphatic filariasis is caused by infection with Wuchereria bancrofti (bancroftian filariasis), Brugia 
malayi, or B. timori (brugian filariasis). It is characterized by early fevers and lymphangitis, then  
progressive lymphatic obstruction of the affected area, often a limb. Occult filariasis (tropical 
pulmonary eosinophilia) is a clinical variant of W. bancrofti infection.

Onchocerciasis
Onchocerciasis (filariasis or river blindness) is caused by infection with the filarial nematode,  
Onchocerca volvulus. The vector is the black fly which breeds near fast flowing rivers. Clinically it  
appears as an itchy papular rash progressing to skin thickening with loss of elasticity and subcutaneous 
nodules. The eyes are often also involved.

Ivermectin
ATC code: P02CF01

Tablet (scored): 3 mg; 6 mg
Indications: Suppressive treatment of onchocerciasis (also known as river blindness), lymphatic 

filariasis and strongyloidiasis.
Contraindications: Pregnancy (delay treatment until after delivery).
Precautions: Loiasis coinfection: may develop life-threatening encephalopathy.
Hyper-reactive onchodermatitis: more likely to have serious adverse reactions especially oedema, 

transient worsening of onchodermatitis.

Dose:
Onchocerciasis and lymphatic filariasis.  

Oral:  
Child over 5 years and over 15 kg 150 micrograms/kg as a single dose once a year or as 
necessary.

Strongyloidiasis. Uncomplicated disease.  
Oral:  
Child over 5 years and over 15 kg 200 micrograms/kg once daily for 2 days, take with fatty food.

Strongyloidiasis. Immunocompromised patients, complicated or disseminated infection.  
Oral:  
Child over 5 years and over 15 kg an extended course of 200 micrograms/kg once daily on days 
1, 2, 15 and 16.

Cutaneous larva migrans.  
Oral:  
Child over 5 years and over 15 kg 200 micrograms/kg daily for 1–2 days.  
In complicated or disseminated infection, daily dosing may be required and expert advice 
should be sought. 
Treatment is not always successful, especially in immunosuppressed patients, and may need to 
be repeated at monthly intervals or a longer course given.

72	 WHO Model Formulary for Children 2010



6.1      Anthelminthics
Renal impairment: Dose reduction not necessary.
Hepatic impairment: Dose reduction not necessary.
Adverse effects: In onchocerciasis, adverse effects are more frequent and more severe due to allergic 

or inflammatory responses to death of the parasite (Mazzotti reaction; see below).
Common Urticaria, vertigo, tremor, raised liver enzymes (ALT and AST), decreased leukocyte count, 

eosinophilia, increased haemoglobin.
Strongyloidiasis Diarrhoea, nausea, dizziness, somnolence, abdominal pain.
Onchocerciasis Mazzotti reaction (see below).
Uncommon Pruritus, rash, mild ocular irritation.
Strongyloidiasis Fatigue, constipation, vomiting, tremor, rash, itch.
Onchocerciasis Headache.
Rare Postural hypotension, leukopenia, anaemia, toxic epidermal necrolysis, Stevens-Johnson syndrome.
Mazzotti reaction Occurs within 3 days of treatment, resulting from death of microfilariae; fever, 
headache, sore throat, cough, rash, conjunctivitis, arthralgia, myalgia, lymphadenopathy, lymphadenitis, oedema, 
weakness, tachycardia, nausea and vomiting, diarrhoea.
Interactions with other medicines (* indicates severe):
	 Alcohol: may increase bioavailability of ivermectin.
Notes: Patient advice Absorption of ivermectin is enhanced when dosage is taken following ingestion of a 
fatty meal. Orange juice modestly reduces ivermectin absorption.
Onchocerciasis This treatment does not kill the adult worm, so you may need further treatment.
Strongyloidiasis You will need to have your stools checked to see if the treatment was effective.
Drug of choice for strongyloidiasis.
After a single dose to treat onchocerciasis, skin microfilariae levels are low for up to 9 months 

(ivermectin does not kill the adult worm).

6.1      Anthelminthics
Notes: Should not be used first line for onchocerciasis.
Diethylcarbamazine should be administered after meals.
Close medical supervision is necessary particularly in the early phase of treatment. In heavy 

infections there may be a febrile reaction, and in heavy Loa loa infection there is a small risk of 
encephalopathy. In such cases treatment must be given under careful in-patient supervision and 
stopped at the first sign of cerebral involvement (and specialist advice sought).

discomfort (dose-dependent), diarrhoea, rectal bleeding, anorexia, colic, reversible rises in hepatic 
aminotransferases.

Rare Hypersensitivity reactions including fever, pruritus, eosinophilia (may be due to dead and dying 
parasites), arrhythmia.

Interactions with other medicines (* indicates severe):
	 Albendazole: increased plasma concentration of active metabolite of albendazole.
*	 Carbamazepine: may significantly decrease praziquantel serum concentration.
	 Chloroquine: plasma praziquantel concentration possibly reduced.
*	 Dexamethasone: plasma praziquantel concentration reduced.

6.2      Antibacterials

6.2      Antibacterials
Choice of a suitable antibacterial drug
The choice of an antibacterial drug is based on the identity of the likely pathogen and its antibacterial 
sensitivity, as well as consideration of various factors relating to the patient (e.g. history of allergy, 
renal and hepatic function, immune status, severity of illness, ethnic origin and age).

Antibacterial policy
Local policies often limit the availability of antibacterials in order to achieve reasonable economy 
consistent with adequate antibacterial cover, and to reduce the development of resistant organisms.  
A policy may allow a range of drugs for general use, and permit use of other drugs only on the advice 
of a microbiologist or physician responsible for the control of infectious diseases. Guidelines for the 
management of specific diseases should be consulted when selecting an antibacterial agent.

Before starting therapy
The following should be considered before starting antimicrobial therapy:
•	 Viral infections should not be treated with antibacterials. Viral upper respiratory tract infections 

and uncomplicated diarrhoea do not require antibacterial medications.
•	 When possible, samples should be taken for culture and sensitivity testing. “Blind” antibacterial 

prescribing for unexplained fever usually leads to further difficulty in establishing the diagnosis.
•	 Knowledge of prevalent organisms and their current sensitivity is of great help in choosing an 

antibacterial before bacteriological confirmation is available.
•	 The choice of an antibiotic for a particular infection should be as specific as possible, reserving 

broad-spectrum cover for very unwell patients (e.g. those with severe acute malnutrition) when 
the infecting organism is either unknown or may be one many different species. Narrowing the 
spectrum, when possible, minimizes potential resistance and limits toxic effects to the patient.

•	 The dose of an antibacterial varies according to a number of factors including age, weight, hepatic 
function, renal function and severity of infection. The prescribing of the so-called “standard” 
dose in serious infections may result in failure of treatment; therefore it is important to prescribe 
a dose appropriate to the condition. An inadequate dose may also increase the likelihood of 
antibacterial resistance. On the other hand, for an antibacterial with a narrow margin between its 
toxic and therapeutic doses (e.g. an aminoglycoside), it is equally important to avoid an excessive 
dose. In such cases, the concentration of the drug in the plasma may need to be monitored.

•	 The route of administration of an antibacterial often depends on the severity of the infection. 
Life-threatening infections generally require intravenous therapy. However, antibacterials that are 
well absorbed can be given by mouth even for some serious infections. When possible, painful 
intramuscular injections should be avoided in children.

•	 Duration of therapy depends on the nature of the infection and the response to treatment. 
Courses should not be unduly prolonged because this encourages resistance, and prolonged 
therapy may also lead to unwanted side-effects and unnecessary expense. However, in certain 
infections, such as tuberculosis or chronic osteomyelitis, it is necessary to treat for prolonged 
periods.

WHO Model Formulary for Children 2010	 79



6	 Anti-infective medicines

6.2.1	 Beta-lactam medicines
Beta-lactam antibiotics include penicillins, cefalosporins and carbapenems. These share a common 
structure and are bactericidal, through a mechanism of action directed at the bacterial cell wall.

Hypersensitivity
The most important adverse effect of penicillins is hypersensitivity, which causes a rash, and occasionally 
anaphylaxis, which can be fatal. Allergic reactions to penicillins occur in 1–10% of exposed individuals, 
while anaphylactic reactions occur in fewer than 0.05%. Individuals with a history of anaphylaxis, 
urticaria or rash immediately after penicillin administration are at risk of immediate hypersensitivity 
with subsequent exposure to penicillins. These individuals should not receive a penicillin, cefalosporin 
or any other beta-lactam antibiotic. Patients who are allergic to one penicillin will be allergic to them 
all because hypersensitivity is related to the basic penicillin structure. About 10–15% of penicillin-
sensitive patients will be allergic to cefalosporins and other beta-lactams.
Individuals with a history of a minor rash (a non-confluent rash restricted to a small area of the 
body) or a rash occurring more than 72 hours after penicillin administration are possibly not allergic 
to penicillin. In these individuals, a penicillin should not be withheld unnecessarily for a serious 
infection.

Suspected meningococcal disease (before transfer to hospital). 
IV or IM:  
Infant under 1 year 300 mg. 
Child 1–9 years 600 mg;  
10 years and over 1.2 g.

Congenital syphilis.  
IV: 
Infant and Child up to 2 years 30 mg/kg twice daily for the first 7 days of life, then 30 mg/kg 
three times daily for 3 days. 
IV or IM:  
Child 2 years and over 120–180 mg/kg (to a maximum of 1.44 g) daily in 4–6 divided doses for 
10–14 days.

Renal impairment: Severe: maximum 6 g daily; neurotoxicity (high doses may cause convulsions).
Hepatic impairment: Dose reduction not necessary.
Adverse effects: Common Diarrhoea, nausea, rash, urticaria, pain and inflammation at injection site, 

superinfection (including candidiasis) especially during prolonged treatment with broad-spectrum 
penicillins, allergy.

Uncommon Fever, vomiting, erythema, exfoliative dermatitis, angioedema, Clostridium difficile-
associated disease.

Rare Anaphylaxis, bronchospasm, tooth discoloration, joint pains, interstitial nephritis, serum 
sickness-like syndrome, haemolytic anaemia, electrolyte disturbances (due to their sodium or 
potassium content), neurotoxicity (e.g. seizures with high doses or impaired renal function), 
coagulation disorders, blood dyscrasias (e.g. neutropenia (related to dose and duration of 
treatment), thrombocytopenia), nephropathy (with parenteral use), Stevens-Johnson syndrome, 
toxic epidermal necrolysis, Jarisch-Herxheimer reaction. This consists of fever, chills, headache, 
hypotension and flare-up of lesions (due to release of pyrogens from the organisms and 
endotoxins) during treatment for syphilis and other spirochaete infections. Lasts for 12–24 hours; 
symptoms can be alleviated by acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin) or prednisolone; can be dangerous in 
cardiovascular syphilis or where there is serious risk of local damage, e.g. optic atrophy.

Interactions with other medicines (* indicates severe):
	 Contraceptives, oral: contraceptive effect of estrogens possibly reduced (risk probably small).
	 Methotrexate: reduced excretion of methotrexate (increased risk of toxicity).
Notes: Intravenous route preferred for neonates and infants; doses over 1.2 g by intravenous route 

only.
IV penicillins are physically incompatible with many substances (including aminoglycosides); give 

separately.
Avoid rapid IV administration of large doses as it may result in convulsions. Longer administration 

time is particularly important when using doses of ≥ 50 mg/kg to avoid CNS toxicity.
Contains 3.4 mmol (78 mg) sodium per 1.2 g injection.

age, ceftriaxone and calcium-containing products may be administered sequentially, provided the 
infusion lines are thoroughly flushed between infusions with a compatible fluid).

Precautions: Sensitivity to beta-lactam antibacterials (avoid if history of immediate hypersensitivity 
reaction; see also section 6.2.1); severe renal impairment; hepatic impairment if accompanied by 
renal impairment; premature neonates (may displace bilirubin from serum albumin); treatment 
longer than 14 days, renal failure, dehydration or concomitant total parenteral nutrition (risk 
of ceftriaxone precipitation in gallbladder); false-positive urinary glucose (if tested for reducing 
substances) and false-positive Coombs’ test.

Dose:
Infections due to susceptible organisms. 

Deep IM or IV:  
Neonate 7 days or under 50 mg/kg daily  (maximum dose 1 g); 
Neonate over 7 days 75 mg/kg daily (maximum dose 1 g).

6	 Anti-infective medicines
Adverse effects: Common Diarrhoea, nausea, rash, electrolyte disturbances, abnormalities in liver 

function enzymes, pain and inflammation at injection site, thrombocytosis, leukopenia.
Uncommon Vomiting, headache, dizziness, oral and vaginal candidiasis, Clostridium difficile-

associated disease, superinfection, eosinophilia, drug fever.
Rare Anaphylaxis, bronchial obstruction, urticaria, haemolytic anaemia, angioedema, Stevens-

Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, interstitial nephritis, arthritis, serum sickness-like 
syndrome, neurotoxicity (including seizures), blood dyscrasias (including thrombocytopenia, 
neutropenia, haemolytic anaemia, anaemia, haemolysis), prolongation of prothrombin time, 
renal impairment, pancreatitis, increased bilirubin, jaundice, pseudolithiasis (dose-dependent, 
asymptomatic and reversible biliary sludge formation due to calcium-ceftriaxone complex; has 
been mistaken for gallstones on ultrasound scans and usually resolves after stopping treatment), 
nephrolithiasis (formation of calcium-ceftriaxone renal stones, sometimes requiring treatment; 
usually reversible).

Interactions with other medicines (* indicates severe):
Calcium salts.
	 Ciclosporin: increased risk of ciclosporin toxicity (renal dysfunction, cholestasis, paraesthesia).
	 Lactated Ringer’s solution: formation of ceftriaxone-calcium precipitates and is contraindicated.
	 Ringer’s solution: formation of ceftriaxone-calcium precipitates and is contraindicated.
	 Typhoid vaccine, live: decreased immunological response to the typhoid vaccine.
	 Contraceptives, oral: contraceptive effect of estrogens possibly reduced (risk probably small).
*	 Warfarin: possibly enhanced anticoagulant effect.
Notes: Cefotaxime is preferred to ceftriaxone for Gram-negative septicaemia in neonates as 

ceftriaxone displaces bilirubin from albumin and may increase risk of bilirubin encephalopathy. 
However, single dose ceftriaxone is used to treat neonatal gonococcal conjunctivitis.

Concomitant use of ceftriaxone and intravenous calcium-containing products is contraindicated in 
neonates (< 28 days of age). Ceftriaxone should not be used in neonates (< 28 days of age) if they 
are receiving (or are expected to receive) calcium-containing intravenous products.

In patients > 28 days of age, ceftriaxone and calcium-containing products may be administered 
sequentially, provided the infusion lines are thoroughly flushed between infusions with a 
compatible fluid. Ceftriaxone must not be administered simultaneously with intravenous calcium-
containing solutions via a Y-site in any age group.

6.2      Antibacterials
Adverse effects: Common Diarrhoea, nausea, rash, electrolyte disturbances, pain and inflammation 

at injection site.
Uncommon Vomiting, headache, dizziness, oral and vaginal candidiasis, Clostridium difficile-

associated disease, superinfection, eosinophilia, drug fever.
Rare Life-threatening arrhythmias with rapid IV administration, anaphylactic shock, bronchial 

obstruction, urticaria, haemolytic anaemia, angioedema, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic 
epidermal necrolysis, interstitial nephritis, arthritis, serum sickness-like syndrome, neurotoxicity 
(including seizures), blood dyscrasias (e.g. neutropenia (related to dose and treatment duration), 
thrombocytopenia), bleeding, renal impairment.

Interactions with other medicines (* indicates severe):
Cefalosporins can cause renal impairment; administration with other drugs which also have this 

effect may increase risk of nephrotoxicity.
	 Aminoglycosides: concomitant cefalosporins and aminoglycoside therapy has been reported to 

result in inactivation of the aminoglycoside. Preferable to separate administration by one hour.
	 Typhoid vaccine, live: decreased immunological response to the typhoid vaccine. Suggestion: 

allow 24 hours or more to elapse between the last dose of antibiotic and the administration of oral 
live typhoid vaccine.

Notes: Rapid IV administration of large doses may result in seizures, especially if inappropriately 
high doses are used in renal impairment.

Use instead of ceftriaxone for Gram-negative septicaemia in neonates.

metabolism; also reported in infants born to mothers treated in late pregnancy.
Interactions with other medicines (* indicates severe):
	 Atazanavir: may increase chloramphenicol serum concentration. Monitor carefully for bone 

marrow suppression.
*	 Ciclosporin (+ calcineurin inhibitors): plasma concentration of ciclosporin possibly increased.
	 Hydroxocobalamin: response to hydroxocobalamin reduced.
	 Iron: systemic chloramphenicol increases serum iron concentration due to chloramphenicol-

induced bone marrow toxicity; if myelosuppression occurs, monitor iron stores and decrease iron 
dose as needed; consider stopping chloramphenicol, seek specialist advice.

	 Lopinavir + ritonavir: may increase chloramphenicol serum concentration. Monitor carefully for 
bone marrow suppression.

*	 Phenobarbital: metabolism of chloramphenicol accelerated (reduced chloramphenicol 
concentration).

*	 Phenytoin: plasma phenytoin concentration increased (increased risk of toxicity).
	 Protease inhibitors: may increase chloramphenicol serum concentration. Monitor carefully for 

bone marrow suppression.
100	 WHO Model Formulary for Children 2010



6.2      Antibacterials
	 Rifampicin: accelerated metabolism of chloramphenicol (reduced plasma chloramphenicol 

concentration).
	 Ritonavir: may increase chloramphenicol serum concentration. Monitor carefully for bone 

marrow suppression.
	 Saquinavir: may increase chloramphenicol serum concentration. Monitor carefully for bone 

marrow suppression.

to) typhoid fever, septicaemia, meningitis, epiglottitis, pneumonia, cerebral abscess, mastoiditis, 
rickettsia, listeriosis, Whipple disease, Q fever and psittacosis.

Systemic use is limited by its toxicity; if using a high dose, reduce it as soon as possible; avoid 
repeated courses and prolonged treatment. Obtain complete blood picture before and during 
treatment (this will not warn of aplastic anaemia); consider stopping treatment if haematological 
changes occur. Stop treatment if peripheral neuropathy or optic neuritis occur.

Reconstitution and administration Reconstitute according to manufacturer’s directions. For 
intermittent intravenous infusion, dilute reconstituted solution further in glucose 5% or sodium chloride 0.9%. 
The oily injection is for intramuscular use only (see notes above).

multiforme, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, Jarisch-Herxheimer reaction, 
hyperglycaemia, blood coagulation disorder.

Interactions with other medicines (* indicates severe):
	 Antacids (aluminium hydroxide; magnesium hydroxide): reduced absorption of ciprofloxacin.
*	 Artemether + lumefantrine: manufacturer of artemether with lumefantrine advises to avoid 

concomitant use.
	 Calcium salts: reduced absorption of ciprofloxacin.
*	 Ciclosporin: increased risk of nephrotoxicity.
	 Contraceptives, oral: contraceptive effect of estrogens possibly reduced (risk probably small).
	 Dairy products: reduced absorption of ciprofloxacin.
	 Ferrous salts: absorption of ciprofloxacin reduced by oral ferrous salts.
*	 Ibuprofen: possibly increased risk of seizures.
	 Methotrexate: increased methotrexate concentration and risk of toxicity when high-dose 

methotrexate is given; monitor methotrexate concentration carefully as increased rescue treatment 
with calcium folinate may be needed.

	 Morphine: manufacturer of ciprofloxacin advises to avoid premedication with morphine (reduced 
plasma ciprofloxacin concentration) when ciprofloxacin used for surgical prophylaxis.

	 Phenytoin: plasma phenytoin concentration can be increased or decreased by ciprofloxacin.
	 Theophylline: may result in increased plasma levels of theophylline and significant adverse effects.
	 Thyroid hormones: ciprofloxacin may interfere with absorption of thyroxine, resulting in 

hypothyroidism; separate drug administration times during a long ciprofloxacin course, and 
monitor thyroid function.

*	 Warfarin: enhanced anticoagulant effect.
	 Zinc sulfate: reduced absorption of ciprofloxacin.
Notes: Best taken on an empty stomach. Separate doses from iron, antacids and milk by 2 hours.
Important to maintain an adequate fluid intake.
Consider the necessity for intravenous administration as adequate levels can be achieved using oral 

formulations due to high bioavailability.
Can cause photosensitivity. Use sunscreen, wear protective clothing and a hat.
Administration For intravenous administration, administer by slow intravenous infusion over 60 minutes. 
Final concentration for administration should not exceed 2 mg/ml.

Gentamicin
ATC code: J01GB03

Injection: 10 mg; 40 mg (as sulfate)/ml in 2 ml vial

Aminoglycosides are associated with significant nephrotoxicity; vestibular and permanent 
bilateral auditory ototoxicity can occur; tinnitus or vertigo are indications of vestibular injury 
and impending bilateral irreversible deafness. Risk of nephrotoxicity and ototoxicity is increased 
in patients with impaired renal function, high-dose therapy or prolonged therapy. Risk of 
nephrotoxicity increases when used concurrently with other potentially nephrotoxic drugs; renal 
damage is usually reversible. Risk of ototoxicity increases with use of potent diuretics.

Special Notes: This medicine is listed as a representative of its pharmacological class. Other 
medicines in the same class may have similar clinical performance and may be selected for local 
formularies based on availability and price. The information in this monograph only applies to the 
medicine listed here.

Indications: Treatment of infections with susceptible organisms taking local resistance factors into 
account, including septicaemia, pneumonia, acute pyelonephritis and meningitis.

Contraindications: Myasthenia gravis.
Precautions: Renal impairment; neonates and infants (use with caution and monitor renal, auditory 

and vestibular function, and serum gentamicin concentrations); avoid prolonged use; conditions 
characterized by muscular weakness; obesity (use ideal body weight to calculate dose and monitor 
serum gentamicin concentration closely).

Dose:
Treatment of infections with susceptible organisms.  

IV or IM:  
Term neonate 3.5–5 mg/kg once daily.  
Infant or Child under 10 years 7.5 mg/kg once daily;  
over 10 years 6 mg/kg once daily (maximum dose 240–360 mg).

Therapeutic drug monitoring Monitor serum gentamicin concentration and reduce doses or 
increase dosing intervals, or both, as necessary. Pre-dose (“trough”) concentration should be less than 1 mg/litre.

Renal impairment: Reduce dose frequency. Monitor renal, auditory and vestibular function. Monitor 
serum gentamicin concentration.

Hepatic impairment: Dose reduction not necessary.
Adverse effects: Common Nephrotoxicity (see below), ototoxicity (see below).
Rare Hypomagnesaemia, hypokalaemia, hypocalcaemia, anaphylaxis (probably due to sulfites in 

some formulations), bronchospasm, neuromuscular blockade (see below), oliguria, peripheral 
neuropathy, antibiotic-associated colitis.

WHO Model Formulary for Children 2010	 107



6	 Anti-infective medicines
Nephrotoxicity Usually reversible and can be anticipated if treatment lasts > 7–10 days; usually presents as 
gradually worsening non-oliguric renal failure with increasing serum creatinine and proteinuria, but may present 
as acute tubular necrosis.
Ototoxicity Clinically evident vestibular ototoxicity (nausea, vomiting, vertigo, nystagmus, difficulties with 
gait) and cochlear ototoxicity (noticeable hearing loss, tinnitus, feeling of fullness in ear) have been associated 
with gentamicin use. As the patient is unaware of the first symptoms of cochlear toxicity, it may appear to begin 
after stopping treatment. Ototoxicity caused by gentamicin can be irreversible; permanent deafness may occur.
Neuromuscular blockade May result in respiratory depression; can usually be reversed with prompt 
administration of IV calcium gluconate; the effect of neostigmine is variable.
Interactions with other medicines (* indicates severe):
	 Amphotericin B: increased risk of nephrotoxicity.
	 Capreomycin: increased risk of nephrotoxicity and ototoxicity.
*	 Ciclosporin: increased risk of nephrotoxicity.
	 Digoxin: possibly increased plasma concentration of digoxin.
*	 Furosemide: increased risk of ototoxicity.
	 Magnesium sulfate: additive neuromuscular blocking effect with aminoglycosides and parenteral 

magnesium sulfate; use combinations cautiously, monitor respiratory function.
*	 Neostigmine: antagonism of effect of neostigmine.
	 Nondepolasing neuromuscular blockers: aminoglycosides prolong effect of nondepolarising 

neuromuscular blockers; may lead to respiratory insufficiency.
	 Other nephrotoxic agents: co-administration with other drugs which are ototoxic or nephrotoxic 

may increase risk of these adverse effects.
	 Penicillins: concomitant penicillin and aminoglycoside therapy has been reported to result in 

inactivation of the aminoglycoside. Preferable to separate administration by 1 hour.
*	 Pyridostigmine: antagonism of effect of pyridostigmine.
*	 Suxamethonium: enhanced muscle relaxant effect.
	 Vancomycin: increased risk of nephrotoxicity and ototoxicity.
*	 Vecuronium: enhanced muscle relaxant effect.
Notes: In obese or severely oedematous children use the ideal weight for height to calculate dose.
Administration For intravenous infusion, dilute in glucose 5% or sodium chloride 0.9%; infuse over 
30–60 minutes. Final concentration of intravenous administration should not exceed 10 mg/ml.
Administer other antibiotics, such as cefalosporins and penicillins, at least 1 hour before or after 

gentamicin.
Target serum concentrations may vary depending on indication and institution.

110	 WHO Model Formulary for Children 2010



6.2      Antibacterials
Adverse effects: Common Dose related gastrointestinal disorders (including nausea and vomiting, 

anorexia, diarrhoea and abdominal pain), hypersensitivity reactions (including urticaria, rash, 
sialadenitis, pruritus, angioedema), headache.

Uncommon Drowsiness, vertigo, dizziness.
Rare Peripheral polyneuropathy (see below), cholestatic jaundice, hepatitis, hepatotoxicity (see below), 

acute and chronic pulmonary reactions (see below), skin reactions including erythema multiforme, 
Stevens-Johnson syndrome, exfoliative dermatitis, lupus-like syndrome, anaphylaxis, drug fever, 
blood disorders including eosinophilia, arthralgia, pancreatitis, benign intracranial hypertension.

Hepatotoxicity Acute hepatocellular or cholestatic reactions generally occur in the first 6 weeks of 
treatment, sometimes with fever, eosinophilia, rash and are usually reversible. Chronic active hepatitis (sometimes 
reversible) mostly occurs in women, usually after about 6 months treatment; may be associated with pulmonary 
toxicity (see below). Both types can be fatal.
Pulmonary toxicity Pulmonary fibrosis has been reported. Possible association with lupus 
erythematosus-like syndrome.
Peripheral polyneuropathy Begins with peripheral paraesthesia and sensory loss (usually in lower 
limbs); can progress to motor loss and muscle atrophy. Improvement usually occurs after stopping treatment, but 
it may be incomplete. The main predisposing factor appears to be renal impairment.
Interactions with other medicines (* indicates severe):
	 Fluconazole: concurrent use may result in increased risk of hepatic and pulmonary toxicity.
	 Norfloxacin: may result in antagonism of the antibacterial effect of norfloxacin.
	 Folic acid: concurrent use may result in decreased folic acid serum levels.
Notes: Give with food or milk to reduce nausea and to improve absorption.
Patient advice Patients and their carers should be advised to tell their doctor immediately if they have 
difficulty breathing, develop a cough or get any numbness or tingling.
Monitoring During long-term treatment monitor the following: pulmonary function; liver function 
every month for 3 months, then every 3 months, as onset of hepatotoxicity may be insidious; renal function as 
peripheral polyneuropathy is more likely to occur if this is impaired; for development of paraesthesia as stopping 
treatment early can prevent severe neuropathy.

include anaphylaxis, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, serum sickness-like syndrome, lupus-
like syndrome, pneumonitis, hepatitis, interstitial nephritis, systemic vasculitis and pancytopenia.
Interactions with other medicines (* indicates severe):
Trimethoprim is a folate antagonist and will add to the effects on bone marrow of other folate 

antagonists, e.g. pyrimethamine.
Trimethoprim can cause hyperkalaemia; administration with potassium supplements or other drugs 

which also cause potassium retention can further increase potassium concentration.
Trimethoprim with sulfamethoxazole can cause nephrotoxicity; giving with other nephrotoxic drugs 

may cause additional renal adverse effects.
*	 Azathioprine: increased risk of haematological toxicity.
*	 Ciclosporin: increased risk of nephrotoxicity; plasma ciclosporin concentration possibly reduced 

by intravenous trimethoprim.
	 Dapsone: plasma concentration of both dapsone and trimethoprim may increase with 

concomitant use.
	 Digoxin: plasma concentration of digoxin possibly increased.
	 Lamivudine: competes for renal excretion, increasing lamivudine concentration and risk of 

toxicity.
*	 Mercaptopurine: increased risk of haematological toxicity.

6.2      Antibacterials
*	 Methotrexate: antifolate effect of methotrexate increased (avoid concomitant use).
*	 Phenytoin: antifolate effect and plasma phenytoin concentration increased.
*	 Pyrimethamine: increased antifolate effect.
	 Rifampicin: decreases concentrations of trimethoprim and sulfamethoxazole when used for 

prophylaxis in HIV-positive patients, decreasing its efficacy.
*	 Sulfadoxine + pyrimethamine: increased antifolate effect.
	 Warfarin: possibly enhanced anticoagulant effect.
Notes: Oral dose is best given with or after food.
Attention should be paid to the folate status of the patient should treatment be prolonged or high 

dose.
Dilution and administration For intermittent intravenous infusion may be further diluted in 
glucose 5% and 10% or sodium chloride 0.9% or Ringer’s intravenous solution. Must be further diluted; dilute 
each 5 ml of injection solution to 125 ml. Infuse over 60–90 minutes (but may be adjusted according to fluid 
requirements). If fluid restriction necessary, 5 ml may be diluted with 75 ml of glucose 5% and the required dose 
infused over a maximum of 60 minutes. Check container for haze or precipitant during administration. In severe 
fluid restriction may be given undiluted via a central venous line.

Special Notes: Vancomycin is a complementary antibacterial drug for use only when there is 

significant resistance to other drugs on the WHO Model List of Essential Medicines for Children.
Indications: Treatment of infections with susceptible organisms including methicillin-resistant 

staphylococcal pneumonia, staphylococcal meningitis, antibiotic-associated colitis, endocarditis 
treatment and prophylaxis. Local antimicrobial patterns need to be taken into account.

Contraindications: History of deafness.
Precautions: Avoid rapid infusion (risk of anaphylactoid reactions, see Adverse effects); rotate 

infusion sites; renal impairment; monitor plasma vancomycin concentration (after three or four 
doses in normal renal function, earlier if renal impairment), blood counts, urine analysis and renal 
function tests: use only in hospital setting; monitor auditory function and plasma vancomycin 
concentrations in renal impairment.

116	 WHO Model Formulary for Children 2010



6.2      Antibacterials
Renal impairment: Increase dose interval or reduce dose, or both, in renal impairment.
Monitor plasma vancomycin concentration and renal function regularly.
Adverse effects: Common IV: local pain (may be severe), thrombophlebitis. Oral: usually only causes 

gastrointestinal adverse effects if significant serum concentrations occur, e.g. in renal impairment. 
Nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea and chills.

Uncommon Nephrotoxicity including renal failure (see below).
Rare Ototoxicity (discontinue if tinnitus occurs), interstitial nephritis, serious skin reactions 

(e.g. linear IgA bullous disease, exfoliative dermatitis, erythema multiforme (Stevens-Johnson 
syndrome), toxic epidermal necrolysis, vasculitis, drug rash with eosinophilia and systemic 
symptoms (DRESS)). Blood disorders including thrombocytopenia (may be immune-mediated), 
neutropenia (more likely after at least 1 week and total dose > 25 g), leukopenia, agranulocytosis, 
flushing of the upper body (“red man” syndrome (see below)), anaphylaxis, severe hypotension 
(with shock, cardiac arrest), superinfection, Clostridium difficile-associated disease.

Nephrotoxicity Although reports of frequency are conflicting, it is more common when used with 
aminoglycosides and in renal impairment. It appears to be related to vancomycin serum concentration.
Ototoxicity Dizziness, vertigo and tinnitus can occur. Vancomycin alone rarely causes ototoxicity; risk is 
higher with prolonged use, in renal impairment and when given with other ototoxic drugs, e.g. aminoglycosides; 
deafness may be permanent.
Red man syndrome Usually due to infusion being given too quickly. It is not an allergic reaction 
although symptoms are partly due to histamine release; they include fever, chills, erythema, facial and upper torso 
rash, which may be followed by hypotension, angioedema and itch. May be treated with antihistamines (e.g. 
promethazine); successful administration is usually possible by increasing the infusion time (e.g. to 120 minutes).
Interactions with other medicines (* indicates severe):
	 Amikacin: increased risk of nephrotoxicity and ototoxicity.
	 Amphotericin B: possibly increased risk of nephrotoxicity.
	 Capreomycin: increased risk of nephrotoxicity and ototoxicity.
*	 Ciclosporin: increased risk of nephrotoxicity.
*	 Furosemide: increased risk of ototoxicity.
	 Gentamicin: increased risk of nephrotoxicity and ototoxicity.
	 Halothane: hypersensitivity-like reactions can occur with concomitant intravenous vancomycin.
	 Ketamine: hypersensitivity-like reactions can occur with concomitant intravenous vancomycin.
	 Nitrous oxide: hypersensitivity-like reactions can occur with concomitant intravenous 

vancomycin.
	 Paromomycin: increased risk of otoxicity.
	 Streptomycin: increased risk of nephrotoxicity and ototoxicity.
*	 Suxamethonium: enhanced effects of suxamethonium.
	 Thiopental: hypersensitivity-like reactions can occur with concomitant intravenous vancomycin.
Notes: Injection may be given orally for Clostridium difficile infection (see Dose); flavouring syrups 

may be added to the solution at the time of administration.
Administration Give over at least 60 minutes (rate not to exceed 10 mg/minute for doses > 500 mg) via 
central venous catheter if possible; avoid extravasation; never give IM. Do not mix with other drugs in parenteral 
solutions.

6.2.3	 Antileprosy medicines
Leprosy is a chronic mycobacterial infection due to Mycobacterium leprae, which is a slow-growing 
intracellular bacillus that infiltrates the skin, peripheral nerves, the nasal and other mucosa and the eyes; 
it affects people of all ages and both sexes. The incubation period between infection and appearance of 
leprosy is normally between 2 and 10 years, but may be up to 20 years. It is transmitted from person to 
person when bacilli are shed from the nose. For treatment purposes, patients may be classified as having 
either paucibacillary (PB) or multibacillary (MB) leprosy. The two forms may be distinguished by skin 
smears, but facilities are not always available to process them and their reliability is often doubtful. In 
practice, most leprosy programmes classify patients and choose a regimen based on the number of skin 
lesions, i.e. PB leprosy: one to five skin lesions; MB leprosy, more than five skin lesions.
Rifampicin, clofazimine and dapsone are used in the treatment of leprosy and should always be 
used as combination therapy; this is essential to prevent the emergence of resistance.
Lepra reactions are episodes of sudden increase in the activity of leprosy, and are often accompanied 
by neuritis. Reactions must always be treated promptly to prevent permanent nerve damage and 
disability. Leprosy multidrug therapy should continue without interruption during a lepra reaction. 
This reduces the frequency and severity of lepra reactions.
Type 1 lepra reactions (reversal reactions) are delayed hypersensitivity reactions, characterized by 
redness and swelling of pre-existing skin lesions and possible increased motor/sensory loss before 
ulceration of the lesion. This may occur in either PB or MB leprosy.
The type 2 lepra reaction (erythema nodosum leprosum [ENL]), characterized by fever and multiple 
red tender nodules, is an antibody response to dead leprosy bacteria and occurs only in MB leprosy.

Clofazimine
ATC code: J04BA01

Capsule: 50 mg; 100 mg
Special Notes: Medicines used in the treatment of leprosy should never be used except in 

combination. Combination therapy is essential to prevent the emergence of drug resistance.
Indications: Treatment of multibacillary (MB) leprosy (and where classification between MB and 

paucibacillary leprosy cannot be made) as part of combination therapy; treatment of type 2 lepra 
reactions (erythema nodosum leprosum).

Precautions: Pre-existing gastrointestinal symptoms (reduce dose, increase dose interval or 
discontinue if symptoms develop during treatment); liver and renal impairment; may discolour 
soft contact lenses.

Skilled tasks Warn patient or carer about the risk of undertaking tasks requiring attention or coordination, 
for example riding a bike or operating machinery, for about 24 hours.

118	 WHO Model Formulary for Children 2010

Type 2 lepra reaction (erythema nodosum leprosum).  
Oral:  
Child all ages 100 mg two or three times daily. Continue treatment for 3 months. 4–6 weeks 
treatment may be required before effect is seen.

Adverse effects: Uncommon Reversible discoloration of skin, hair, cornea, conjunctiva, tears, 
sweat, sputum, faeces and urine, gastrointestinal pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, weight loss, 
gastrointestinal bleeding, severe mucosal and submucosal oedema, dry skin, acne-like eruptions, 
rashes, pruritus, photosensitivity, decreased sweat production, dry eyes.

Rare Headache, drowsiness, dizziness, taste disorders, elevation of blood glucose concentration.
Interactions with other medicines (* indicates severe):
*	 Phenytoin: reduced phenytoin serum concentrations and loss of phenytoin efficacy.
Notes: The drug is well tolerated and virtually non-toxic in the dosage used for multidrug therapy 

(MDT). The drug causes brownish black discoloration and dryness of skin. However, this 
disappears within a few months after stopping treatment. This should be explained to patients 
starting a MDT regimen for MB leprosy.

6.2.4	 Antituberculosis medicines
Antituberculosis treatment in children
The main objectives of antituberculosis treatment are to:

1.	 cure the patient of tuberculosis (TB) (by rapidly eliminating most of the bacilli)
2.	 prevent death from active TB or its late effects
3.	 prevent relapse of TB (by eliminating the dormant bacilli)
4.	 prevent the development of drug resistance (by using a combination of drugs)
5.	 decrease TB transmission to others.

Children with TB usually have paucibacillary (low organism numbers) pulmonary disease. They also 
develop extrapulmonary TB more often than adults. Severe and disseminated TB (e.g. TB meningitis and 
miliary TB) occurs more frequently in young children (less than 3 years old). Both the bacillary load and 
the type of disease may influence the effectiveness of treatment regimens. Treatment outcomes in children 
are generally good, even in young and immunocompromised children, provided treatment is started 
promptly. Studies demonstrate that very few of the drug adverse events more commonly reported in adults 
occur as commonly in children, when used in doses suggested in WHO treatment regimens.
122	 WHO Model Formulary for Children 2010



6.2      Antibacterials

Treatment regimens
Anti-TB treatment is divided into two phases: an intensive phase and a continuation phase. The 
purpose of the intensive phase is to rapidly eliminate the majority of organisms and to prevent the 
emergence of drug resistance. This phase uses a greater number of drugs than the continuation phase. 
The purpose of the continuation phase is to eradicate the dormant organisms. Fewer drugs are generally 
used in this phase because the risk of acquiring drug resistance is low, as most of the organisms have 
already been eliminated. Daily treatment is preferred for therapy, but treatment can be given three times 
weekly provided the treatment is directly observed. Three times weekly therapy is not recommended in 
settings where there is high HIV-prevalence, or for HIV-positive individuals.

Recommended dosages
Note that dose recommendations for several first-line anti-TB medications have recently been 
revised. Recommended doses for several medications have been increased, because current evidence 
suggests that serum drug levels may be lower in children than in adults. Children with TB must be 
followed up regularly and have dosages adjusted for weight gained.
Two or more new drugs should be added to any re-treatment regimen in cases of genuine failure of 
treatment.

Children with TB who are co-infected with HIV
HIV-infected children are at greater risk for TB infection and TB disease than children not infected 
with HIV. HIV-infected children also have a poorer response to TB treatment and higher rates of 
mortality associated with TB disease. The majority of deaths in HIV-infected children being treated 
for TB occur in the first 2 months of TB treatment during the intensive phase.

Management of relapse and drug-resistant TB in children
In childhood TB cases when anti-TB treatment fails or a relapse occurs, every effort should be made 
to find the most likely cause for the failure or relapse. Mycobacterial culture and drug susceptibility 
testing should be performed for all re-treatment cases.
Drug-resistant TB is a public health problem in many countries. Second-line drugs are required 
to manage these infections. There is limited experience with the safety of many of these drugs in 
children. No drug is absolutely contraindicated in children; however, benefits have to be carefully 
weighed against risks. These drugs are indicated for the treatment of multidrug-resistant TB in  
children and should only be used in specialized centres.

Capreomycin
ATC code: J04AB30

Powder for injection: 1 g in vial

The use of capreomycin in patients with renal insufficiency or pre-existing auditory impairment 
must be undertaken with great caution. Risk of additional cranial nerve VIII impairment or 
renal injury.
Since other parenteral antituberculosis agents (streptomycin, viomycin) also have similar and 
sometimes irreversible toxic effects, particularly on cranial nerve VIII and renal function, 
simultaneous administration of these agents with capreomycin is not recommended. Use 
with non-antituberculosis drugs (polymyxin A sulfate, colistin sulfate, amikacin, gentamicin, 
tobramycin, vancomycin, kanamycin and neomycin) having ototoxic or nephrotoxic potential, 
should be undertaken only with great caution.

Special Notes: Monitor body weight monthly and adjust dose accordingly.
Second-line medicines should be reserved for the treatment of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis 

(MDR-TB) and should be used in specialized centres adhering to WHO standards for TB control.
Indications: Treatment of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis, in combination with other drugs.
Contraindications: Hypersensitivity to aminoglycoside antibiotics.
Precautions: Auditory impairment; concomitant use with streptomycin or viomycin; renal 

impairment; renal injury; myasthenia gravis.

Ethionamide
ATC code: J04AD03

Tablet: 125 mg; 250 mg
Special Notes: Second-line medicines should be reserved for the treatment of multidrug-resistant 

tuberculosis (MDR-TB) and should be used in specialized centres adhering to WHO standards for 
TB control.

Indications: Treatment of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis and tuberculosis meningitis.
Contraindications: Severe hepatic impairment.
Precautions: AIDS infection (drug malabsorption may be a problem); diabetes mellitus; renal 

impairment; hepatic impairment. 

Dose:
Treatment of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis and tuberculosis meningitis.  

Oral:  
Child 15–20 mg/kg once daily if tolerated; divided doses if necessary. Maximum 1 g/day.

 
Renal impairment: Severe: reduce to 50% of dose.

Hepatic impairment: Mild and moderate impairment: use with caution.
Severe impairment: avoid use.
Adverse effects: Common Gastrointestinal disturbance (see below).
Uncommon Hepatotoxicity.
Rare Hypotension, rash, fever, hypoglycaemia, hypothyroidism, gynaecomastia, photosensitivity, 

thrombocytopenia, encephalopathy, neuropathy, seizures, visual disturbances, ototoxicity.
Gastrointestinal adverse effects Gastrointestinal irritation is the major limiting factor in the 
therapeutic use of ethionamide. The most frequent adverse effects of ethionamide are nausea, vomiting and 
diarrhoea. Anorexia, excessive salivation, stomatitis and a metallic taste in the mouth occur less frequently. 
Abdominal discomfort, described as epigastric pain or burning, is common with therapeutic doses. These effects 
appear to be dose related. In general, half of the patient population is unable to tolerate 1 g of ethionamide as a 
single dose. Gastrointestinal effects are more common in females than males, and are less common in children. 
Persons of Asian or African descent reportedly tolerate this drug better than those of European descent.
Interactions with other medicines (* indicates severe):
	 Aminosalicylic acid: excessive adverse effects (GI distress and hepatotoxicity).
	 Cycloserine: neurological adverse effects, including seizures.
	 Ethambutol: excessive adverse effect (GI distress, headache, confusion, neuritis and 

hepatotoxicity).
	 Isoniazid: increased isoniazid levels, peripheral neuritis, hepatotoxicity and encephalopathy.
	 Pyrazinamide: hepatotoxicity.
	 Rifampicin: hepatotoxicity.
Notes: Concurrent administration of pyridoxine may reduce peripheral neuropathy.
Administration of an antiemetic agent 30 minutes prior to ethionamide and administration of 

ethionamide at bedtime have been suggested in patients experiencing gastrointestinal adverse 
effects.

Baseline liver function tests including serum transaminases, bilirubin and alkaline phosphatase 
should be obtained and regularly monitored (e.g. every 2–4 weeks) during ethionamide therapy.

6.3      Antifungal medicines
Fungal infections are increasing in prevalence globally, and can be classified as superficial or systemic. 
Superficial infections affect the skin, hair, nails or mucous membranes; systemic fungal infections affect 
the body as a whole. Systemic fungal infections may occur as opportunistic infections in patients 
who are immunocompromised, and are associated with high mortality rates.
Duration of therapy depends on the initial severity of the infection and the clinical response of the 
patient. In some infections, a satisfactory response is only obtained after several months or more of 
continuous treatment.

Amphotericin B
ATC code: J02AA01

Powder for injection: 50 mg in vial
As deoxycholate or liposomal

Amphotericin B is available as deoxycholate, lipid complex and liposomal; these should not be 
considered interchangeable.
Care with product formulation. Large overdoses have occurred when conventional formulations 
were dispensed inadvertently for lipid based or liposomal products. Single daily doses of 
conventional amphotericin B formulation never exceed 1.5 mg/kg.
Anaphylaxis has been reported with amphotericin B containing drugs; facilities for 
cardiopulmonary resuscitation should be available during administration due to the possibility 
of anaphylactic reaction.
Intravenous amphotericin B is used primarily for the treatment of patients with progressive 
fungal infections; not to be used for non-invasive forms of fungal disease.

Special Notes: Also known as amphotericin.
Amphotericin B is available as the conventional deoxycholate complex and liposomal forms. It is also 

available in a lipid complex form (not included in the 2nd WHO Model list of essential medicines 
for children).

Indications: Life-threatening fungal infections including histoplasmosis, coccidioidomycosis, 
paracoccidioidomycosis, blastomycosis, aspergillosis, cryptococcosis, mucormycosis, sporotrichosis 
and candidiasis.

Contraindications: Known hypersensitivity.
Precautions: Close medical supervision throughout treatment and initial test dose required (see 

Anaphylaxis, below); renal impairment; hepatic and renal function tests; blood counts and plasma 
electrolyte (including potassium and magnesium concentration) monitoring; avoid rapid infusion 
(risk of arrhythmias).

WHO Model Formulary for Children 2010	 143



6	 Anti-infective medicines
Liposomal Diabetes as each 50 mg vial of liposomal amphotericin B contains 900 mg of sucrose.
Anaphylaxis Anaphylaxis occurs rarely with intravenous amphotericin B and a test dose is advisable 
before the first infusion. The patient should be observed for at least 30 minutes after the test dose. Prophylactic 
antipyretics or hydrocortisone should only be used in patients who have previously experienced acute adverse 
reactions (in whom continued treatment with amphotericin B is essential).

Dose:
Conventional amphotericin B (as deoxycholate)  

Systemic fungal infections.  
IV:  
Neonate, Infant or Child  initial test dose of 100 micrograms/kg (maximum 1 mg) included as 
part of first dose, then 250 micrograms/kg daily, gradually increased up to 1 mg/kg daily or in 
severe infection, up to maximum of 1.5 mg/kg daily.  
Prolonged treatment is usually necessary. For prolonged treatment, a higher dose (maximum 
1.5 mg/kg) may be given on alternate days. If treatment is interrupted for longer than 7 days, 
recommence at 250 micrograms/kg daily and increase gradually.

Liposomal amphotericin B  
Systemic fungal infections.  
IV:  
Neonate, Infant or Child  initial test dose 100 micrograms/kg (maximum 1 mg) then 1 mg/kg 
once daily, increased in steps of 1 mg/kg daily up to 3 mg/kg once daily; maximum 5 mg/kg 
once daily if necessary for severe infection.

Renal impairment: Mild to severe: use only if no alternative. No dosage reduction is necessary, but 
further impairment is likely with conventional (as deoxycholate) amphotericin B. Nephrotoxicity 
may be reduced with use of liposomal formulations.

Hepatic impairment: Dose reduction not necessary.
Adverse effects: Adverse effects are similar for all amphotericin B formulations; the rates depend on 

the formulation used; liposomal formulations are generally better tolerated.
Common Fever, headache, nausea and vomiting, anorexia, hypokalaemia, hypomagnesaemia, 

diarrhoea, epigastric pain, muscle and joint pain, infusion reactions (see below), thrombophlebitis, 
anaemia, nephrotoxicity (see below).

Uncommon Hypotension, hypertension, cardiac arrest, arrhythmias (rapid infusion of conventional 
amphotericin B), blood dyscrasias, gastrointestinal bleeding, elevated liver enzymes, hepatotoxicity, 
rash, neurological effects (e.g. seizures, confusion, blurred vision, hearing loss, tinnitus).

Rare Anaphylactoid reactions, hyperkalaemia (especially in renal impairment), cardiovascular toxicity 
(including arrhythmias, ECG changes).

Nephrotoxicity Conventional (as deoxycholate) amphotericin B affects renal function in all patients; 
changes are dose related and generally reversible (except with cumulative doses > 3–5 g). Distal tubular 
damage may lead to loss of concentrating ability, renal tubular acidosis, nephrocalcinosis, hypokalaemia and 
hypomagnesaemia. Anuria or oliguria may occur. Risk is greater in those with renal impairment or when used 
with other nephrotoxic drugs. Nephrotoxicity may be associated with sodium depletion.
Liposomal amphotericin B is less nephrotoxic than conventional (deoxycholate) amphotericin B.
Infusion reactions Include fever, chills, hypotension, anorexia, nausea, vomiting, headache, malaise, 
muscle and joint pain; usually lessen with continued treatment.
Continuous infusion of conventional (as deoxycholate) amphotericin B reduces infusion reactions.
With liposomal amphotericin B one or more acute infusion reactions (chest pain, hypoxia, dyspnoea, severe 
abdominal, flank or leg pain, flushing and urticaria) may occur; these may be related to the liposomal component; 
frequency is very variable.

144	 WHO Model Formulary for Children 2010



6.3      Antifungal medicines
Interactions with other medicines (* indicates severe):
Amphotericin B is nephrotoxic; administration with other nephrotoxic drugs or cytotoxic drugs may 

cause additional renal impairment.
It may also reduce potassium concentration; administration with other drugs with this effect may 

worsen hypokalaemia. Monitor potassium concentration; supplements may be needed.
	 Amikacin: increased risk of nephrotoxicity.
	 Azoles (e.g. fluconazole): possible antagonistic effect; potentially reduced antifungal efficacy.
*	 Ciclosporin: increased risk of nephrotoxicity.
*	 Dexamethasone: increased risk of hypokalaemia (avoid concomitant use unless dexamethasone 

needed to control reactions).
*	 Digoxin: hypokalaemia caused by amphotericin B increases cardiac toxicity of digoxin.
	 Fluconazole: possible antagonism of effect of amphotericin B.
	 Flucytosine: renal excretion of flucytosine decreased and cellular uptake increased (flucytosine 

toxicity possibly increased).
	 Furosemide: increased risk of hypokalaemia.
	 Gentamicin: increased risk of nephrotoxicity.
	 Hydrochlorothiazide: increased risk of hypokalaemia.
*	 Hydrocortisone: increased risk of hypokalaemia (avoid concomitant use unless hydrocortisone 

needed to control reactions).
	 Miconazole: possible antagonism of effects of amphotericin B.
	 Paromomycin: possible increased risk of nephrotoxicity.
	 Pentamidine: possible increased risk of nephrotoxicity.
*	 Prednisolone: increased risk of hypokalaemia (avoid concomitant use unless prednisolone needed 

to control reactions).
	 Streptomycin: increased risk of nephrotoxicity.
	 Vancomycin: possible increased risk of nephrotoxicity.
Notes: Check renal function before starting treatment; monitor renal function and electrolytes 

(especially potassium, magnesium and sodium) at least three times a week and complete blood 
picture and hepatic function twice a week during treatment and until stable after treatment stops.

Liposomal formulations of amphotericin B are less nephrotoxic than conventional amphotericin B; 
the few comparative clinical trials between conventional and liposomal formulations appear to 
show similar efficacy.

Conventional (as deoxycholate): use an antihistamine, paracetamol and/or hydrocortisone in patients 
who have previously experienced acute adverse reactions to prevent or treat infusion reactions.

Administration advice (both formulations). Incompatible with sodium chloride solutions; flush 
existing line with glucose 5% or use a separate line.
Do not mix with any other drugs.
After initial reconstitution, do not administer without further dilution.
Conventional amphotericin B (as deoxycholate) Reduce risk of thrombophlebitis by using large peripheral veins 
or a central venous catheter, changing venous access sites frequently and infusing over longer periods.
Reconstitute as per product instructions including further dilution with glucose 5% to produce a final 
concentration of 0.1 mg/ml (in fluid restricted children up to 0.4 mg/ml if given via a central line).
Initial test dose should be given over 20–30 minutes. To minimize infusion related reactions, infuse the initial 
treatment dose slowly over 4–6 hours; tolerance to infusion reactions increases with subsequent doses, which may 
allow a shorter infusion, however, do not give over < 2 hours.
Liposomal amphotericin B Reconstitute as per product instructions including filtering through a 5 micron filter 
and further dilute with glucose 5% to produce a final concentration of 0.2–2 mg/ml.
Initial test dose should be given over 10 minutes. Then infuse subsequent doses over 30–60 minutes.

necrolysis, peripheral neuropathy.

Rare Anaphylaxis, hepatic necrosis, blood disorders including thrombocytopenia, leukopenia and 
aplastic anaemia.

Interactions with other medicines (* indicates severe):
Flucytosine depresses the bone marrow; administration with other drugs which also have this effect 

may increase the risk of myelosuppression.
146	 WHO Model Formulary for Children 2010



6.3      Antifungal medicines
If it is given with nephrotoxic drugs, its renal excretion may be reduced, increasing the risk of 

toxicity.
	 Amphotericin B: renal excretion of flucytosine decreased and cellular uptake increased 

(flucytosine toxicity possibly increased).
	 Cytarabine: plasma flucytosine concentration possibly reduced.
	 Zidovudine: concomitant administration may increase the risk of haematological toxicity. Caution 

if used together.
Notes: Monitoring is essential in renal impairment, when using with amphotericin B, or if there is an 

increased risk of bone marrow suppression, e.g. in patients with AIDS.
Resistance to flucytosine can develop during therapy and sensitivity testing is essential before and 

during treatment.
Take the capsules with food to reduce stomach upset.
Plasma concentration monitoring For plasma concentration monitoring, blood should be 
taken shortly before starting the next infusion (or before next dose by mouth). Plasma concentration for optimum 
response 25–50 mg/l (200–400 micromol/l) and should not exceed 80 mg/l (620 micromol/l).

6.4.1	 Antiherpes medicines
Herpes simplex infections
Aciclovir is active against herpes viruses but does not eradicate them. It is indicated in children for 
herpes simplex virus (HSV) infections but is only effective if started early in the course of infection. 
HSV infections can be primary or reactivation infections, and include superficial infections, genital 
herpes, eczema herpeticum, herpetic whitlow and eye involvement. HSV encephalitis is a serious, 
treatable condition that should not be missed. Invasive and disseminated infection can occur in  
immunocompromised patients.

Varicella-zoster infection (chickenpox)
Chickenpox in neonates should be treated with parenteral aciclovir to reduce the risk of severe disease. 
Otherwise, antiviral treatment is generally not required except for immunocompromised patients and 
those at special risk (e.g. those with severe cardiovascular or respiratory disease or a chronic skin disorder).
While most HIV-positive patients with herpes zoster (shingles) experience only one self-limiting disease 
course, some will suffer repeated episodes. Treatment should be reserved for debilitating disease and 
when there is a high risk of serious complications, such as in advanced HIV disease.

6.4.2	 Antiretrovirals
Antiretroviral therapy in children
Antiretroviral (ART) medicines are essential for the treatment and prevention of HIV infection in 
children, prevention of mother-to-child transmission (MTCT) and post-exposure prophylaxis. Studies 
of ART in children demonstrate that similar improvements to those obtained in adults are seen in 
morbidity, mortality and surrogate markers with many different potent ART regimens.
ART in children is aimed at reducing the plasma viral load as much as possible for as long as possible, 
in order to improve immune function, reduce risk of opportunistic infections and other complications 
of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection (e.g. encephalopathy and malignancy) and facilitate 
improved growth, development and quality of life.
In all populations, drug therapy should be designed to minimize the risk of toxicity and development 
of resistance, and maximize long-term compliance.
Unique considerations for the use of ART in children include the following:
•	 fewer drug choices than for adults (e.g. efavirenz is not approved for children less than 3 years of age)
•	 limitations of formulations for paediatric patients (e.g. large volumes required [e.g. stavudine 

liquid], poor palatability [e.g. ritonavir], the need for refrigeration [e.g. lopinavir] and short 
shelf-life [e.g. didanosine])

•	 limitations of currently available pharmacokinetic data for children, leading to uncertain dosing 
regimens for some medications

150	 WHO Model Formulary for Children 2010



6.4      Antiviral medicines
•	 the need for dose adjustment as children grow (to avoid under-dosing and drug resistance)
•	 less data regarding toxicity for children and non-specific clinical manifestations of toxicity in 

infants
•	 longer potential cumulative treatment duration.
Prevention of mother-to-child transmission
To prevent the transmission of HIV from mother to baby, WHO promotes a comprehensive  
approach, which includes the following four components:
•	 primary prevention of HIV infection among women of childbearing age
•	 preventing unintended pregnancies among women living with HIV
•	 preventing HIV transmission from a woman living with HIV to her infant
•	 providing appropriate treatment, care and support to mothers living with HIV and to their 

children and families.
Detailed recommendations for prevention of MTCT of HIV, including the role of ART, can be  
accessed at the following website:
http://www.who.int/hiv/topics/mtct/en/index.html
Post-exposure prophylaxis
Treatment with antiretroviral drugs may be appropriate following exposure to HIV-contaminated 
materials and sexual assault. Current WHO guidelines on post-exposure prophylaxis to prevent HIV 
infection are accessible at the following website: http://www.who.int/hiv/topics/prophylaxis/en/
Fixed-dose drug combinations
•	 Fixed-dose drug combinations, now available in many regions, allow for easier administration of 

antiretroviral medications based on age or weight bands. They have the advantages of being  
relatively more affordable, more tolerable for children than multiple tablets, avoiding dosing  
errors and potentially improving adherence. 
 
 
 

Lamivudine + Nevirapine + Stavudine
ATC code: J05AR07

Tablet: 150 mg + 200 mg + 30 mg
Tablet (dispersible): 30 mg + 50 mg + 6 mg; 60 mg + 100 mg + 12 mg

Antiretroviral dosing The doses of antiretroviral drugs included in this formulary 
are based on the WHO guidelines for treatment of paediatric HIV (Antiretroviral therapy 
of HIV infection infants and children: towards universal access. Recommendations for a public 
health approach). At the time of printing, these guidelines were under review. Prescribers are 
encouraged to consult the latest guidelines as they are continually updated as further data or 
newer formulations become available.

WHO Model Formulary for Children 2010	 151



6	 Anti-infective medicines

The dosing guidance for antiretroviral drugs provided in this formulary has been simplified and 
includes weight-based tables, as the calculation and administration of exact doses based on body 
surface area may be impractical in resource-limited settings. The target doses for each drug are 
included in the tables; however in many cases the dose achieved for a particular patient weight 
may be significantly higher or slightly lower than the target dose. Decisions about dosing were 
based upon manufacturer’s information, the antiretroviral drug formulation choices, available 
data from clinical studies, and expert paediatric pharmacology consultation, and were directed 
towards what could be considered the “optimal” dose for a particular weight band, given the 
limitations imposed by currently available drug formulations and the public health advantages 
of simplified dosing tables.
Situations that are frequently encountered in resource-limited settings, including the possible 
lack of refrigeration and the lack of syrup or liquid forms for small children are taken into 
consideration. Some of the formulations used to create these simplified dosing guidelines are 
not included on the 2nd WHO Model List of Essential Medicines for Children but may be 
available locally.
Prescribers are urged to consider if the dosing guidelines are appropriate for adoption given the 
antiretroviral drugs and formulations available locally.

Special Notes: Also referred to as 3TC+NVP+d4T.
Indications: HIV infection (alone as a complete regimen, or in combination with other antiretroviral 

drugs).
Contraindications: Nevirapine Moderate or severe hepatic impairment; post-exposure 

prophylaxis.
Precautions: Lamivudine Pancreatitis (see below); renal impairment; chronic hepatitis B or C; 

hepatic disease (see below).
Pancreatitis If no suitable alternative exists, use with extreme caution in children with advanced HIV infection, 
previous history of pancreatitis or risk factors for pancreatitis.
Hepatic disease Potentially life-threatening lactic acidosis and severe hepatomegaly with steatosis reported; 
caution in children with hepatomegaly, hepatitis (especially hepatitis C treated with interferon alfa and ribavirin), 
liver enzyme abnormalities or risk factors for liver disease and hepatic steatosis; discontinue if rapid deterioration 
in liver function tests, symptomatic hyperlactataemia, progressive hepatomegaly or lactic acidosis. Exacerbation of 
hepatitis in patients with chronic hepatitis B may occur on discontinuation of lamivudine.
Nevirapine Hepatic impairment; chronic hepatitis B or C; high CD4 cell count.
Hepatic disease Potentially life-threatening hepatotoxicity including fatal fulminant hepatitis reported 
usually in the first 6 weeks; close monitoring required during first 18 weeks; discontinue permanently if liver 
abnormalities accompanied by hypersensitivity reaction (rash, fever, arthralgia, myalgia, lymphadenopathy, 
hepatitis, renal impairment, eosinophilia, granulocytopenia); suspend if severe liver abnormalities but no 
hypersensitivity reaction; discontinue permanently if significant liver function abnormalities recur, monitor 
patient closely if mild to moderate liver abnormalities with no hypersensitivity reaction.
Rash Rash, usually in first 6 weeks, is most common side-effect; incidence reduced if introduced at low dose 
and dose increased gradually, monitor closely for skin reactions during first 18 weeks; discontinue permanently 
if severe rash or if rash accompanied by blistering, oral lesions, conjunctivitis, facial oedema, general malaise or 
hypersensitivity reactions; if rash mild or moderate, may continue without interruption but dose should not be 
increased until rash resolves.
Patient advice Patients and/or caregivers should be told how to recognize hypersensitivity reactions and 
advised to discontinue treatment and seek immediate medical attention if symptoms of hepatitis, severe skin 
reaction or hypersensitivity reactions develop.
Stavudine Peripheral neuropathy (see below); pancreatitis (see below); chronic hepatitis B or C; 

hepatic disease (see below); renal impairment.

152	 WHO Model Formulary for Children 2010



6.4      Antiviral medicines
Peripheral neuropathy Suspend if peripheral neuropathy develops (characterized by persistent numbness, 
tingling or pain in feet or hands); if symptoms resolve satisfactorily on withdrawal and if stavudine needs to be 
continued, resume treatment at half previous dose.
Pancreatitis Avoid use or use extreme caution in patients with history of pancreatitis. If symptoms of pancreatitis 
develop or if serum amylase or lipase is raised (even if asymptomatic), suspend treatment until diagnosis of 
pancreatitis excluded; on return to normal values, re-initiate treatment only if essential (using low dose increased 
gradually if appropriate). Whenever possible, avoid concomitant treatment with other drugs known to cause 
pancreatic toxicity (for example, intravenous pentamidine isetionate); monitor closely if concomitant therapy 
unavoidable. Since significant elevations of triglycerides cause pancreatitis, monitor closely if elevated.
Hepatic disease Potentially life-threatening lactic acidosis and severe hepatomegaly with steatosis reported. 
Caution in patients with hepatomegaly, hepatitis, liver enzyme abnormalities or risk factors for liver disease 
and hepatic steatosis; discontinue if rapid deterioration in liver function tests, symptomatic hyperlactataemia, 
progressive hepatomegaly or lactic acidosis.

Dose:
HIV infection (alone as a complete regimen, or in combination with other antiretroviral drugs).
Special considerations for dosing A lead-in dose of nevirapine, half of the normal daily 
dosage, is used for 2 weeks to decrease the likelihood of rash incidence. For children < 30 kg, use of 14 day 
lead-in decreases the incidence of rash.
If the child experiences a rash in the lead-in period, then remain on the half dosage until the rash resolves. 
Wait no longer than 28 days for the rash to resolve then seek an alternative regimen.

WHO Model Formulary for Children 2010	 159



6	 Anti-infective medicines

Lamivudine + Zidovudine
ATC code: J05AR01

Tablet: 30 mg + 60 mg; 150 mg + 300 mg

Antiretroviral dosing The  doses of antiretroviral drugs included in this formulary 
are based on the WHO guidelines for treatment of paediatric HIV (Antiretroviral therapy of 
HIV infection in infants and children: towards universal access. Recommendations for a public 
health approach). At the time of printing, these guidelines were under review. Prescribers are 
encouraged to consult the latest guidelines as they are continually updated as further data or 
newer formulations become available.
The dosing guidance for antiretroviral drugs provided in this formulary has been simplified and 
includes weight-based tables, as the calculation and administration of exact doses based on body 
surface area may be impractical in resource-limited settings. The target doses for each drug are 
included in the tables; however in many cases the dose achieved for a particular patient weight 
may be significantly higher or slightly lower than the target dose. Decisions about dosing were 
based upon manufacturer’s information, the antiretroviral drug formulation choices, available 
data from clinical studies, and expert paediatric pharmacology consultation, and were directed 
towards what could be considered the “optimal” dose for a particular weight band, given the 
limitations imposed by currently available drug formulations and the public health advantages 
of simplified dosing tables.
Situations that are frequently encountered in resource-limited settings, including the possible lack 
of refrigeration and the lack of syrup or liquid forms for small children are taken into consideration. 
Some of the formulations used to create these simplified dosing guidelines are not included on the 
2nd WHO Model List of Essential Medicines for Children but may be available locally.
Prescribers are urged to consider if the dosing guidelines are appropriate for adoption given the 
antiretroviral drugs and formulations available locally.

Special Notes: Also referred to as 3TC + ZDV.
Zidovudine also referred to as AZT.
Indications: HIV infection (in combination with other antiretroviral drugs).
Contraindications: Zidovudine Abnormally low neutrophil counts or haemoglobin; neonates 

either with hyperbilirubinaemia requiring treatment other than phototherapy or with raised 
transaminase; acute porphyria.

Precautions: Lamivudine Pancreatitis (see below); renal impairment; chronic hepatitis B or C; 
hepatic disease (see below).

Pancreatitis If no suitable alternative exists, use with extreme caution in children with advanced HIV infection 
and a previous history of pancreatitis or risk factors for pancreatitis.
Hepatic disease Potentially life-threatening lactic acidosis and severe hepatomegaly with steatosis reported; 
caution in children with hepatomegaly, hepatitis (especially hepatitis C treated with interferon alfa and ribavirin), 
liver enzyme abnormalities or risk factors for liver disease and hepatic steatosis; discontinue if rapid deterioration 
in liver function tests, symptomatic hyperlactataemia, progressive hepatomegaly or lactic acidosis. Exacerbation of 
hepatitis in patients with chronic hepatitis B may occur on discontinuation of lamivudine.
Zidovudine Haematological toxicity including vitamin B12 deficiency, anaemia and 

myelosuppression; renal impairment; chronic hepatitis B or C; hepatic disease (see below).
Hepatic disease Potentially life-threatening lactic acidosis and severe hepatomegaly with steatosis reported. 
Exercise caution in patients with hepatomegaly, hepatitis, liver enzyme abnormalities or risk factors for liver 
disease and hepatic steatosis; discontinue if there is any rapid deterioration in liver function tests, symptomatic 
hyperlactataemia, progressive hepatomegaly or lactic acidosis.

Abacavir
ATC code: J05AF06

Oral liquid: 20 mg (as sulfate)/ml
Tablet: 300 mg (as sulfate)

Serious and sometimes fatal hypersensitivity reactions have been associated with abacavir: 
approximately 5% of adults and children (rate varies by race/ethnicity) receiving abacavir 
develop a potentially fatal hypersensitivity reaction.
Antiretroviral dosing The doses of antiretroviral drugs included in this formulary 
are based on the WHO guidelines for treatment of paediatric HIV (Antiretroviral therapy of 
HIV infection in infants and children: towards universal access. Recommendations for a public

Special Notes: Also referred to as ABC.
Indications: HIV infection, in combination with other antiretroviral drugs.
Contraindications: Severe renal impairment; severe hepatic impairment; previous hypersensitivity 

reaction to abacavir.
Precautions: Chronic hepatitis B or C; hepatic impairment; renal impairment.
Hypersensitivity reactions Life-threatening hypersensitivity reactions characterized by fever or 
rash and possibly nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, abdominal pain, dyspnoea, cough, lethargy, malaise, headache 
and myalgia, less frequently by mouth ulceration, oedema, hypotension, sore throat, adult respiratory distress 
syndrome, paraesthesia, arthralgia, conjunctivitis, lymphadenopathy, lymphocytopenia, renal failure and 
anaphylaxis (hypersensitivity reactions presenting as sore throat, influenza-like illness, cough and breathlessness 
identified); and rarely by myolysis. Laboratory abnormalities may include raised liver enzymes (see below) and 
creatine kinase. Symptoms usually appear in the first 6 weeks, but may occur at any time; monitor patients for 
symptoms every 2 weeks for 2 months; discontinue immediately if any symptom of hypersensitivity develops and

do not rechallenge (risk of more severe hypersensitivity reaction); discontinue if hypersensitivity cannot be ruled 
out, even when other diagnoses possible (if rechallenge necessary, it must be carried out in hospital setting). If 
abacavir is stopped for any reason other than hypersensitivity, exclude hypersensitivity reaction as the cause, and 
rechallenge only if medical assistance is readily available; care needed with concomitant use of drugs which cause 
skin toxicity. Studies have shown an association between abacavir hypersensitivity and a specific HLA genotype 
(HLA-B*5701). This genetic screening for HLA-B*5701 is recommended prior to initiation of abacavir based 
therapy. The incidence of abacavir hypersensitivity reaction is lower in the non-Caucasian population.
Patient advice Patients and caregivers should be told the importance of regular dosing (intermittent 
therapy may increase sensitization), how to recognize signs of hypersensitivity, and advised to seek immediate 
medical attention if symptoms develop or before restarting treatment.
Hepatic disease Potentially life-threatening lactic acidosis and severe hepatomegaly with steatosis have been 
reported. Caution in patients with hepatomegaly, hepatitis, liver enzyme abnormalities, or risk factors for liver 
disease and hepatic steatosis (including alcohol abuse); discontinue if rapid deterioration in liver function tests, 
symptomatic hyperlactataemia, progressive hepatomegaly or lactic acidosis.

6.4      Antiviral medicines
Special Notes: Also referred to as ddI.
Didanosine is usually reserved for second-line regimens.
Note Antacids in formulation may affect absorption of other drugs; see interactions.
Indications: HIV infection, in combination with at least two other antiretroviral drugs.
Precautions: Pancreatitis; peripheral neuropathy; hyperuricaemia; lactic acidosis or severe 

hepatomegaly with steatosis; chronic hepatitis B or C; retinal or optic nerve changes; renal 
impairment; hepatic impairment.

Pancreatitis Avoid use or use extreme caution in patients with history of pancreatitis. If symptoms of 
pancreatitis develop or if serum amylase or lipase is raised (even if asymptomatic), suspend treatment until 
diagnosis of pancreatitis excluded; on return to normal values, re-initiate treatment only if essential (using low 
dose increased gradually if appropriate). Whenever possible, avoid concomitant treatment with other drugs 
known to cause pancreatic toxicity (for example intravenous pentamidine isetionate, stavudine and hydroxyurea); 
monitor closely if concomitant therapy unavoidable. Since significant elevations of triglycerides cause pancreatitis, 
monitor closely if elevated.
Peripheral neuropathy Dose related, especially in advanced HIV infection. Suspend treatment; 
a reduced dose may be tolerated when symptoms resolve. Please note that giving a lower dose may result in 
suboptimal therapy and an increased risk of treatment failure and the development of resistant mutations; it may 
be advisable to change to another drug at full dose.
Hyperuricaemia Suspend treatment if significant elevation occurs.
Hepatic disease Potentially life-threatening lactic acidosis and severe hepatomegaly with steatosis 
reported; exercise caution in patients with hepatomegaly, hepatitis, liver enzyme abnormalities or risk factors

Renal impairment: Reduce dose in all degrees of impairment; consult product information for 

individual preparations for further specific dosing information.
Hepatic impairment: No dose adjustment recommended. Possible increased risk of toxicity in 

patients with hepatic impairment; monitor for toxicity.
Adverse effects: Common Diarrhoea (sometimes severe, may be related to the antacid present in the 

preparation), abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting.
Uncommon Peripheral neuropathy, electrolyte abnormalities, hyperuricaemia, lactic acidosis, severe 

hepatomegaly with steatosis, pancreatitis, increased liver enzymes, retinal depigmentation, retinal 
changes, optic neuritis, hepatic toxicity, hepatic failure, lipodystrophy (see below).

Lipodystrophy Lipodystrophy has been observed in patients taking antiretroviral agents, but a direct causal 
relationship has not been established.
Interactions with other medicines (* indicates severe):
*	 Allopurinol: possibly increased plasma concentration of didanosine.
*	 Hydroxyurea: increased risk of adverse effects. Avoid concurrent use if possible.
*	 Ribavirin: increased risk of toxicity, hepatic reactions, peripheral neuropathy and pancreatitis.
*	 Ritonavir: simultaneous administration can inactivate both drugs. Give didanosine 1 hour before 

or 2 hours after ritonavir.
*	 Stavudine: increased risk of adverse effects. Avoid concurrent use if possible.
*	 Tenofovir: plasma concentration of didanosine increased (increased risk of toxicity; avoid 

concomitant use).
Notes: Best given on an empty stomach 30 minutes before or at least 2 hours after a meal.
Didanosine is degraded rapidly unless given as an enteric formulation or combined with buffering 

agents or antacids. In children, this degradation effect may be less marked and didanosine may not 
have to be administered on an empty stomach.

Oral suspension Is not easy to use and should be avoided if possible; should be kept refrigerated; stable for 
30 days; must be well shaken.
Tablets At least two tablets of appropriate strength must be used at any one time for adequate buffering (e.g. if 
the child’s dose is 50 mg, administer two 25 mg tablets instead of one 50 mg tablet); didanosine tablets should be 
chewed, crushed or dispersed in water or clear juice before they are taken; tablets should not be swallowed whole.
Enteric-coated beadlets in capsules Can be opened and sprinkled on a small amount of food, 
but this may decrease the area under the curve; do not crush or chew beadlets.

Lamivudine
ATC code: J05AF05

Oral liquid: 10 mg/ml
Tablet: 150 mg

Antiretroviral dosing The doses of antiretroviral drugs included in this formulary 
are based on the WHO guidelines for treatment of paediatric HIV (Antiretroviral therapy of 
HIV infection in infants and children: towards universal access. Recommendations for a public 
health approach). At the time of printing, these guidelines were under review. Prescribers are 
encouraged to consult the latest guidelines as they are continually updated as further data or 
newer formulations become available.
The dosing guidance for antiretroviral drugs provided in this formulary has been simplified and 
includes weight-based tables, as the calculation and administration of exact doses based on body 
surface area may be impractical in resource-limited settings. The target doses for each drug are 
included in the tables; however in many cases the dose achieved for a particular patient weight 
may be significantly higher or slightly lower than the target dose. Decisions about dosing were 
based upon manufacturer’s information, the antiretroviral drug formulation choices, available 
data from clinical studies, and expert paediatric pharmacology consultation, and were directed 
towards what could be considered the “optimal” dose for a particular weight band, given the 
limitations imposed by currently available drug formulations and the public health advantages 
of simplified dosing tables.
Situations that are frequently encountered in resource-limited settings, including the possible 
lack of refrigeration and the lack of syrup or liquid forms for small children are taken into 
consideration. Some of the formulations used to create these simplified dosing guidelines are 
not included on the 2nd WHO Model List of Essential Medicines for Children but may be 
available locally.
Prescribers are urged to consider if the dosing guidelines are appropriate for adoption given the 
antiretroviral drugs and formulations available locally.

174	 WHO Model Formulary for Children 2010



6.4      Antiviral medicines
Peripheral neuropathy Suspend if peripheral neuropathy develops (characterized by persistent 
numbness, tingling or pain in feet or hands); if symptoms resolve satisfactorily on withdrawal, and if stavudine 
needs to be continued, resume treatment at half previous dose. Please note that giving a lower dose may result in 
suboptimal therapy and an increased risk of treatment failure and the development of resistance mutations; it may 
be advisable to change to another drug at full dose.
Pancreatitis Avoid use or use extreme caution in patients with history of pancreatitis. If symptoms of 
pancreatitis develop or if serum amylase or lipase is raised (even if asymptomatic), suspend treatment until 
diagnosis of pancreatitis excluded; on return to normal values, re-initiate treatment only if essential (using 
low dose increased gradually if appropriate). Whenever possible, avoid concomitant treatment with other 
drugs known to cause pancreatic toxicity (for example intravenous pentamidine isetionate); monitor closely if 
concomitant therapy unavoidable. Since significant elevations of triglycerides cause pancreatitis, monitor closely 
if elevated.
Hepatic disease Potentially life-threatening lactic acidosis and severe hepatomegaly with steatosis reported. 
Caution in patients with hepatomegaly, hepatitis, liver enzyme abnormalities, or risk factors for liver disease 
and hepatic steatosis; discontinue if rapid deterioration in liver function tests, symptomatic hyperlactataemia,

includes weight-based tables, as the calculation and administration of exact doses based on body 
surface area may be impractical in resource-limited settings. The target doses for each drug are 
included in the tables; however in many cases the dose achieved for a particular patient weight 
may be significantly higher or slightly lower than the target dose. Decisions about dosing were 
based upon manufacturer’s information, the antiretroviral drug formulation choices, available 
data from clinical studies, and expert paediatric pharmacology consultation, and were directed 
towards what could be considered the “optimal” dose for a particular weight band, given the 
limitations imposed by currently available drug formulations and the public health advantages 
of simplified dosing tables.
Situations that are frequently encountered in resource-limited settings, including the possible 
lack of refrigeration and the lack of syrup or liquid forms for small children are taken into 
consideration. Some of the formulations used to create these simplified dosing guidelines are 
not included on the 2nd WHO Model List of Essential Medicines for Children but may be 
available locally.
Prescribers are urged to consider if the dosing guidelines are appropriate for adoption given the 
antiretroviral drugs and formulations available locally.

Special Notes: Also referred to as EFV or EFZ.
WHO age/weight restriction: > 3 years or > 10 kg weight.
Indications: HIV infection in combination with other antiretroviral drugs.
Contraindications: Pregnancy (substitute nevirapine for efavirenz in pregnant women or women for 

whom effective contraception cannot be assured).
Patient advice Women of childbearing potential should undergo pregnancy testing as well as counselling 
about the risk to the fetus and the need to avoid pregnancy before initiating efavirenz therapy and for 12 weeks 
after stopping therapy. Barrier methods in combination with other (hormonal) methods of contraception should 
be used, as efavirenz may decrease the effectiveness of the oral contraceptive pill. (See Interactions.)
Precautions: Chronic hepatitis B or C; hepatic impairment; severe renal impairment; history of 

mental illness or seizures.
Rash Rash, usually occurring in the first 2 weeks, is the most common adverse effect; discontinue if severe rash 
with blistering, desquamation, mucosal involvement or fever; if rash is mild or moderate, may continue without 
interruption (rash usually resolves within 1 month). Rash is the principal side-effect seen in children, experienced 
by up to 40% of patients. Antihistamines may be useful for treatment and prophylaxis.
Psychiatric disorders Patients should be advised to seek medical attention if severe depression, 
psychosis or suicidal ideation occurs. 

Dose:
Note The bioavailability of efavirenz oral solution is lower than that of the capsules and tablets; the oral 
solution is not interchangeable with either capsules or tablets on a milligram for milligram basis.
HIV infection in combination with other antiretroviral drugs, using oral liquid.  

Oral:  
Infants over 3 months or 10 kg or Child 19.5 mg/kg once daily. Dosing with capsules or tablets 
is preferred due to better bioavailability.

HIV infection in combination with other antiretroviral drugs, using tablets or capsules.

Renal impairment: Severe: avoid use.
Hepatic impairment: Mild to moderate: monitor for dose-related adverse effects (for example central 

nervous system effects) and monitor liver function.
Severe: avoid use.
Therapeutic drug monitoring is possible and may assist in dosing hepatically impaired patients.
Adverse effects: Common Rash (up to 40%, see note in Precautions), abdominal pain, nausea, 

diarrhoea, increased transaminase levels, neurological side effects (see below).
Neurological side-effects Include somnolence, insomnia, abnormal dreams, confusion, abnormal 
thinking, impaired concentration, amnesia, agitation, depersonalization, hallucinations, euphoria; neurological 
side-effects occur more commonly in adults than in children.
Uncommon Hepatitis, pancreatitis, psychosis, mania, seizures.
Rare Depression, suicidal ideation. Possible congenital abnormalities in infants exposed in utero 

during the first trimester.
Interactions with other medicines (* indicates severe):
	 Contraceptives, oral: efficacy of estrogen containing oral contraceptives possibly reduced.
*	 Ergometrine: increased risk of ergotism (avoid concomitant use).
	 Grapefruit juice: plasma concentration of efavirenz possibly increased.
	 Indinavir: efavirenz reduces plasma concentration of indinavir.
	 Lopinavir: plasma concentration of lopinavir reduced.
*	 Midazolam: increased midazolam toxicity (avoid concomitant use).
	 Nevirapine: plasma efavirenz concentration reduced.
	 Rifampicin: reduced plasma concentration of efavirenz (increase efavirenz dose).
	 Ritonavir: increased risk of toxicity (monitor liver function tests).
	 Saquinavir: efavirenz significantly reduces plasma concentration of saquinavir.
*	 St John’s wort (Hypericum): decreased efavirenz concentration and treatment failure.
*	 Voriconazole: decreased voriconazole levels and increased efavirenz levels; consult specialist texts 

for management advice if this combination is necessary.
Notes: Take on an empty stomach, preferably at bedtime. Food, particularly high fat food, increases 

absorption by 50%. Safety of increased levels not assessed.
Capsules may be opened and added to liquids or small amounts of food to disguise their peppery 

taste.
Bedtime dosing is recommended, particularly during the first 2–4 weeks of therapy, to improve 

tolerability of central nervous system side-effects.

Contraindications: Moderate or severe hepatic impairment; post-exposure prophylaxis.
Precautions: Hepatic impairment (see below); rash (see below); chronic hepatitis B or C; high 

CD4 cell count (preferably avoid in women with CD4 cell count greater then 250 cells/mm3 or in 
men with CD4 cell count greater than 400 cells/mm3).

Hepatic disease Potentially life-threatening hepatotoxicity including fatal fulminant hepatitis reported 
usually in the first 6 weeks; close monitoring required during first 18 weeks; assess liver function before treatment 
then every 2 weeks for 2 months, then after 1 month and then regularly; discontinue permanently if liver 
abnormalities accompanied by hypersensitivity reaction (rash, fever, arthralgia, myalgia, lymphadenopathy, 
hepatitis, renal impairment, eosinophilia, granulocytopenia); suspend if severe liver abnormalities but no 
hypersensitivity reaction; discontinue permanently if significant liver function abnormalities recur; monitor 
patient closely if mild to moderate liver abnormalities with no hypersensitivity reaction.
Rash Rash, usually in first 6 weeks, is most common side-effect; incidence reduced if introduced at low dose 
and dose increased gradually, monitor closely for skin reactions during first 18 weeks; discontinue permanently 
if severe rash or if rash accompanied by blistering, oral lesions, conjunctivitis, facial oedema, general malaise or 
hypersensitivity reactions; if rash mild or moderate, may continue without interruption but dose should not be 
increased until rash resolves.
Patient advice Patients and/or caregivers should be told how to recognize hypersensitivity reactions and 
advised to discontinue treatment and seek immediate medical attention if symptoms of hepatitis, severe skin 
reaction or hypersensitivity reactions develop.

Dose:
Progressive or advanced HIV infection, in combination with other antiretroviral drugs. 

Oral:  
Neonate, Infant or Child initially 160–200 mg/m2 (maximum 200 mg) once daily for the first 
14 days, increasing to twice daily after 14 days in the absence of nevirapine-induced rash (see 
Special considerations on dosing, below). 
Special considerations on dosing  
a) Induction dose: once daily for first 14 days; it is generally half the daily maintenance dose 
given once daily except where the maintenance dose is divided unequally between a.m. and 
p.m. 
b) Maintenance dose: target dose is 160–200 mg/m2 given twice daily and adjusted for more 
aggressive dosing in the younger age group. 
c) If a mild rash occurs during the first 14 days of induction dosing, continue once daily dosing 
and only escalate dose once the rash has subsided and the dose is well tolerated. If a severe rash 
occurs (especially if accompanied by fever, blistering or mucosal ulcerations), discontinue drug.

Note If treatment interrupted for more than 7 days, reintroduce with lowest dose and increase dose 
cautiously.
Simplified dosing tables based on weight bands are designed around 50 mg tablets (not on the 2nd

6	 Anti-infective medicines
Lipodystrophy Lipodystrophy has been observed in patients taking antiretroviral agents, but a direct causal 
relationship has not been established.
Interactions with other medicines (* indicates severe):
Note Atazanavir is extensively metabolized by hepatic CYP450 and is a potent CYP3A4 inhibitor and therefore 
interacts with numerous drugs. Consult specialist texts for details and advice on management.
Atazanavir may prolong the PR interval. Use with caution in patients taking other medications which affect AV 
conduction.
When used in combination with ritonavir, see also ritonavir drug interactions.
	 Antacids: reduced absorption. Administer atazanavir 2 hours before or 1 hour after antacids.
*	 Contraceptives, oral: increased concentration and possible toxicity. If used with ritonavir, efficacy 

of estrogen containing oral contraceptives possibly reduced. Consider non-hormonal contraceptive 
methods.

*	 Didanosine: buffered formulations of didanosine reduce atazanavir absorption. Administer 
atazanavir 2 hours before or 1 hour after didanosine.

	 Efavirenz: reduced atazanavir concentration. Use with ritonavir. Dose adjustment may be 
required.

*	 Ergot derivatives: increased risk of ergot toxicity.
*	 Midazolam: increased plasma levels of midazolam. Avoid combination.
	 Nevirapine: reduced atazanavir concentration. Avoid combination.
*	 Omeprazole: decreased atazanavir concentration and therapeutic effect. Dose adjustment 

required; consult product literature.
*	 Ranitidine: reduced absorption. Dose adjustment or careful dose scheduling required. Consult 

product literature.
*	 Rifampicin: decreased atazanavir concentrations. Avoid combination.
	 Ritonavir: plasma concentration possibly increased by ritonavir. This interaction is beneficial and 

ritonavir is used at low doses to increase the serum concentration of other protease inhibitors. 
	 St John’s wort: substantially reduced atazanavir concentration. Avoid combination.
	 Tenofovir: reduced atazanavir concentration. Use with ritonavir booster and give with food. 

Increased tenofovir concentration; care with toxicity.
Notes: Give with food to enhance absorption. Swallow capsules whole, do not open.
Advantage of once daily dosing over other protease inhibitors.
Should be used in combination with ritonavir to optimize drug levels.

6.4      Antiviral medicines

Lopinavir + Ritonavir
ATC code: J05AE03; J05AE06

Capsule: 133.3 mg + 33.3 mg
Oral liquid: 80 mg + 20 mg/ml
Tablet (heat stable): 100 mg + 25 mg; 200 mg + 50 mg

Antiretroviral dosing The doses of antiretroviral drugs included in this formulary 
are based on the WHO guidelines for treatment of paediatric HIV (Antiretroviral therapy 
of HIV infection infants and children: towards universal access. Recommendations for a public 
health approach). At the time of printing, these guidelines were under review. Prescribers are 
encouraged to consult the latest guidelines as they are continually updated as further data or 
newer formulations become available.  
The dosing guidance for antiretroviral drugs provided in this formulary has been simplified and 
includes weight-based tables, as the calculation and administration of exact doses based on body 
surface area may be impractical in resource-limited settings. The target doses for each drug are 
included in the tables; however in many cases the dose achieved for a particular patient weight 
may be significantly higher or slightly lower than the target dose. Decisions about dosing were 
based upon manufacturer’s information, the antiretroviral drug formulation choices, available 
data from clinical studies, and expert paediatric pharmacology consultation, and were directed 
towards what could be considered the “optimal” dose for a particular weight band, given the 
limitations imposed by currently available drug formulations and the public health advantages 
of simplified dosing tables.  
Situations that are frequently encountered in resource-limited settings, including the possible 
lack of refrigeration and the lack of syrup or liquid forms for small children are taken into 
consideration. Some of the formulations used to create these simplified dosing guidelines are 
not included on the 2nd WHO Model List of Essential Medicines for Children but may be 
available locally. 
Prescribers are urged to consider if the dosing guidelines are appropriate for adoption given the 
antiretroviral drugs and formulations available locally.

Special Notes: Also referred to as LPV/r or LPV/RTV.
Note 5 ml oral solution is equivalent to 3 capsules; where appropriate, capsules may be used instead of oral 
solution; oral solution excipients include propylene glycol and alcohol 42%.
Indications: HIV infection, in combination with other antiretroviral drugs.
Note Ritonavir increases effect of lopinavir; the low doses of ritonavir used for this purpose do not have 
intrinsic antiviral activity.
Contraindications: Severe hepatic impairment; severe renal impairment; porphyria.
Precautions: Chronic hepatitis B or C (increased risk of hepatotoxicity); hepatic impairment; 

renal impairment; haemophilia; pancreatitis (see below); diabetes mellitus; cardiac conduction 
disorders; structural heart disease; concomitant use with drugs that prolong QT interval; oral 
solution contains propylene glycol: increased susceptibility to propylene glycol toxicity in slow 
metabolizers.

Pancreatitis Signs and symptoms suggestive of pancreatitis (including raised serum amylase and lipase) 
should be evaluated; discontinue if pancreatitis diagnosed.

Injection for intravenous administration: 800 mg/10 ml and 1 g/10 ml phosphate buffer  
solution
Solid oral dosage form: 200 mg; 400 mg; 600 mg

Ribavirin is potentially mutagenic, tumour promoting and gonadotoxic. May cause birth 
defects and/or death of the exposed fetus.
Both males and females should avoid pregnancy during treatment and for at least 6 months 
after treatment has ceased.

Special Notes: Also referred to as tribavirin.
Indications: Treatment of haemorrhagic fever, including Lassa fever, Argentine haemorrhagic fever 

and Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever; haemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (Hantavirus).
Contraindications: Pregnancy (see below); breastfeeding; severe cardiac disease, including unstable 

or uncontrolled cardiac disease in previous 6 months; haemoglobinopathies (including thalassemia 
or sickle-cell anaemia); haemoglobin levels less than 8 g/dl; severe debilitating medical conditions; 
severe hepatic dysfunction or decompensated cirrhosis of the liver; autoimmune disease (including 
autoimmune hepatitis); renal impairment.

Pregnancy Teratogenic risk; risk of serious fetal abnormalities exists when ribavirin is used during pregnancy, 
but because of the high risk of mortality from haemorrhagic fevers for both pregnant women and the fetus, 
maternal benefit should be considered. Lassa fever is especially severe late in pregnancy, with maternal death or 
fetal loss occurring in more than 80% of cases during the third trimester.
Precautions: For both males and females: contraception essential during and for at least 6 months 

after treatment has ceased, condoms must be used if the partner of the male patient is pregnant (as 
ribavirin is excreted in semen); monitor blood counts at least weekly; pregnant health-care workers 
should not administer ribavirin.

Dose:
Haemorrhagic fevers.  

Oral:  
Child all ages initially 30 mg/kg (maximum 2 g) then 15 mg/kg (maximum 1 g) every 6 hours 
for 4 days, then 7 mg/kg (maximum 500 mg) every 6 hours for 6 days. 
Slow IV infusion:  
Child all ages 17 mg/kg every 6 hours for 4 days, then 7 mg/kg every 8 hours for 6 days. 

Haemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome.  
Slow IV infusion: No paediatric dose.  
Adult initially 33 mg/kg (maximum 1 g) as a single dose, then 16 mg/kg (maximum 1 g) every 
6 hours for 4 days, then 8 mg/kg (maximum 500 mg) every 8 hours for 6 days.

Renal impairment: Avoid use in all degrees of renal impairment.
Hepatic impairment: Dose reduction not necessary; avoid in severe hepatic dysfunction or 

decompensated cirrhosis.
Adverse effects: Common Rash, pruritus, anorexia, dyspnoea, cough, anaemia, haemolytic anemia 

(patients with pre-existing cardiac disease are at increased risk), increase in uric acid concentration.
Uncommon Dizziness, insomnia, irritability, fatigue, depression, suicidal ideation (in combination 

with peginterferon alfa treatment (more frequent in children)), thrombotic thrombocytopenic 
purpura, increases in serum bilirubin and liver enzymes, particularly AST and ALT.

Rare Reticulocytosis, myocardial infarction, arrhythmias, interstitial pneumonitis, pancreatitis, 
hypersensitivity.

Other adverse effects Neutropenia, aplastic anaemia, nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, colitis, fever, rigors, 
myalgia, arthralgia, headache, impaired concentration, anxiety, autoimmune disorders, diabetes, hypothyroidism, 
hyperthyroidism, retinal haemorrhage, retinal thrombosis, alopecia.
Interactions with other medicines (* indicates severe):
Ribavirin causes anaemia; treatment with other drugs which also have this effect may worsen this; 

avoid combinations or monitor closely.
Drug interactions with ribavirin may occur for up to 2 months after stopping ribavirin due to its 

long half-life.
	 Azathioprine: increased risk of azathioprine induced myelotoxicity.
	 Didanosine: ribavirin with didanosine has resulted in didanosine toxicity, e.g. pancreatitis, lactic 

acidosis; avoid combination.
	 Nucleoside/nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs): ribavirin may inhibit activation 

of NRTIs (lamivudine, stavudine and zidovudine appear unaffected); monitor HIV RNA level 
closely and review NRTI treatment if this increases, seek specialist advice. Monitor closely for 
NRTI toxicity.

	 Warfarin: ribavirin may decrease warfarin’s anticoagulant effect; monitor INR and increase 
warfarin dose if needed.

Notes: Oral ribavirin should be taken with food.
Administration Give by slow intravenous infusion (over 10–15 minutes).

6.5      Antiprotozoal medicines

6.5.1	 Antiamoebic and antigiardiasis medicines
Amoebiasis
Amoebic dysentery is caused by Entamoeba histolytica. It is transmitted by the faeco-oral route and 
infection is usually caused by ingestion of cysts from contaminated food and drink. Asymptomatic 
carriers are common in endemic areas. In non-endemic areas, asymptomatic carriers should be 
treated to reduce the risk of transmission and protect the patient from invasive amoebiasis.
Symptomatic (invasive) amoebiasis may be classified as either intestinal or extra-intestinal. Intestinal 
forms of amoebiasis include amoebic dysentery and non-dysenteric amoebic colitis. Extra-intestinal 
amoebiasis most commonly involves the liver, but in some cases may involve the skin, the genito- 
urinary tract, the lung and the brain. Invasive amoebiasis is more likely in malnutrition and immu-
nosuppression, and requires treatment.

Giardiasis
Giardiasis is acquired by oral ingestion of Giardia cysts. Treatment should be offered to all infected 
patients. Larger epidemics are difficult to eradicate because of the high proportion of symptomless 
carriers and because excreted cysts can survive for long periods outside the human host. Treatment of 
asymptomatic carriers is generally not recommended, except possibly in households with immuno-
compromised patients.

Diloxanide
ATC code: P01AC01

Tablet: 500 mg (furoate)
Special Notes: WHO age/weight restriction: > 25 kg weight.
Indications: Amoebiasis (asymptomatic carriers in non-endemic areas; eradication of residual luminal 

amoebae after treatment of invasive disease with other drugs).
Contraindications: Pregnancy (defer treatment until after first trimester).

Dose:
Amoebiasis.  

Oral:  
Child over 25 kg 7 mg/kg (maximum 500 mg) three times daily for 10 days. The course of 
treatment may be repeated if necessary.

Renal impairment: Dose reduction not required.
Hepatic impairment: Dose reduction not required.
Adverse effects: Common Flatulence.
Uncommon Vomiting, pruritus and urticaria.
Interactions with other medicines (* indicates severe):
There are no known interactions where it is recommended to avoid concomitant use.
Notes: Diloxanide is not effective against hepatic amoebiasis, but a 10-day course should be given at 

the completion of metronidazole or tinidazole treatment to destroy any amoebae in the gut.
Treatment with diloxanide is regarded as successful if stools are free of Entamoeba histolytica for 

1 month. Several stool specimens should be examined when evaluating response to treatment.

6.5.2	 Antileishmaniasis medicines
The incidence of leishmania infection is increasing, and children account for a significant proportion 
of those with visceral leishmaniasis in disease endemic areas. Morbidity and mortality related to this 
infection is substantial.
Leishmaniasis is caused by the parasitic protozoa, Leishmania, and is usually categorized as visceral, 
cutaneous or mucocutaneous. It may manifest as a self-limiting localized skin lesion, but can progress 
from this to mucosal involvement, to disseminated progressive disease (cutaneous form) or, without 
treatment, to a fatal disease (visceral form). Humans are the incidental hosts of infection, and mammals, 
such as rodents and canids, are the reservoir hosts. The parasites are transmitted by sandflies. 

Visceral leishmaniasis
Visceral leishmaniasis (kala-azar) is caused by Leishmania donovani and L. infantum (“Old World” 
species), and by L. chagasi (“New World” species). It is usually responsive, at least initially, to the penta-
valent antimony compounds meglumine antimoniate or sodium stibogluconate. Patients are considered 
to be parasitologically cured when no parasites are detected in splenic or bone marrow aspirates.
In some areas, resistance to antimonials is widespread. Amphotericin B or parenteral paromomycin 
may be useful in resistant cases.
WHO Model Formulary for Children 2010	 201



6	 Anti-infective medicines

Cutaneous leishmaniasis
Cutaneous leishmaniasis comprises two conditions. The Old World variety is caused by L. tropica, L. 
major, L. infantum or L. aethiopica. The New World variety is caused by L. amazonensis, L. mexicana, 
L. peruviana, L. guyanensis, L. panamensis or L. braziliensis. The New World variety tends to be more 
severe and slower to heal. Infections caused by L. major, L. mexicana, L. tropica or L. peruviana are 
responsive to intralesional injections of antimonial compounds. Mild lesions can often be left to 
heal spontaneously. However, it is preferable to treat L. tropica infections with a view to reducing 
transmission, since humans seem to be the only host.

Mucocutaneous leishmaniasis
Mucocutaneous leishmaniasis is caused by L. braziliensis or L. panamensis. In this form of the disease, 
the primary lesions do not heal, and spread to the mucosa may occur. It usually responds to  
antimonials and, when relapses occur, further extended courses of treatment are often successful.
Emergency use of corticosteroids may be needed to control pharyngeal or tracheal oedema produced 
by severe inflammation resulting from antigens liberated from dead parasites during the early phase 
of treatment. Antibiotics may also be needed to treat secondary infections. Plastic surgery offers the 
only means of ameliorating disfiguring scars.

Diffuse cutaneous leishmaniasis
Diffuse cutaneous leishmaniasis usually occurs following infection with L. amazonensis, L. aethiopica 
or L. mexicana and should be treated. Relapse is common and repeated courses may be required. 

Amphotericin B
ATC code: J02AA01

Powder for injection: 50 mg in vial as deoxycholate or liposomal

Amphotericin B is available as deoxycholate and as several lipid forms including a liposomal 
form; these should not be considered interchangeable and care should be taken to ensure that 
the form and dose are correct.
Large overdoses have occurred when conventional formulations were dispensed inadvertently 
for lipid based or liposomal products. Single daily doses of conventional amphotericin B 
formulation never exceed 1.5 mg/kg.
Anaphylaxis has been reported with amphotericin B; facilities for cardiopulmonary resuscitation 
should be available during administration due to the possibility of anaphylactic reaction.

Special Notes: Also referred to as amphotericin.
Amphotericin B is available as the conventional deoxycholate complex and liposomal forms. Other 

lipid forms are also available (not included in the Second WHO Model List of Essential Medicines 
for Children).

Indications: Visceral, mucocutaneous and cutaneous leishmaniasis unresponsive to pentavalent 
antimony compounds.

Precautions: Close medical supervision throughout treatment and initial test dose required (see 
Test dose, below); renal impairment; monitor hepatic and renal function tests; blood counts and 
plasma electrolyte (including potassium and magnesium concentration) monitoring required; 
avoid rapid infusion (risk of arrhythmias). Liposomal amphotericin B: diabetes as each 50 mg vial 
of liposomal amphotericin B contains 900 mg of sucrose.

202	 WHO Model Formulary for Children 2010



6.5      Antiprotozoal medicines

Renal impairment: Mild: use only if no alternative. No dosage reduction is necessary, but further 
impairment is likely with conventional (as deoxycholate) amphotericin B. Nephrotoxicity may be 
reduced with use of liposomal formulations.

Hepatic impairment: Dose reduction not necessary.
Adverse effects: Adverse effects are similar for all amphotericin B formulations; the rates depend on 

the formulation used; the liposomal formulation is generally better tolerated.

WHO Model Formulary for Children 2010	 203



6	 Anti-infective medicines
Common Fever, headache, nausea and vomiting, anorexia, diarrhoea, epigastric pain, muscle and 

joint pain, infusion reactions (see below), thrombophlebitis, anaemia, nephrotoxicity (see below).
Uncommon Hypotension or hypertension, hypokalaemia, hypomagnesaemia, cardiac arrest, 

arrhythmias (rapid infusion of conventional amphotericin B), blood dyscrasias, gastrointestinal 
bleeding, elevated liver enzymes, hepatotoxicity, rash, neurological effects (e.g. seizures, confusion, 
blurred vision, hearing loss, tinnitus).

Rare Anaphylactoid reactions, hyperkalaemia (especially in renal impairment), cardiovascular toxicity 
(including arrhythmias, ECG changes).

Nephrotoxicity Conventional (as deoxycholate) amphotericin B affects renal function in all patients; 
changes are dose related and generally reversible (except with cumulative doses > 3–5 g). Distal tubular 
damage may lead to loss of concentrating ability, renal tubular acidosis, nephrocalcinosis, hypokalaemia and 
hypomagnesaemia. Anuria or oliguria may occur. Risk is greater in those with renal impairment or when used 
with other nephrotoxic drugs. Nephrotoxicity may be associated with sodium depletion.
Liposomal amphotericin B is less nephrotoxic than conventional (deoxycholate) amphotericin B.
Infusion reactions Include fever, chills, hypotension, anorexia, nausea, vomiting, headache, malaise, 
muscle and joint pain; usually lessen with continued treatment.
Continuous infusion of conventional (as deoxycholate) amphotericin B reduces infusion reactions.
With liposomal amphotericin B, one or more acute infusion reactions (chest pain, hypoxia, dyspnoea, severe 
abdominal, flank or leg pain, flushing and urticaria) may occur; these may be related to the liposomal component; 
frequency is very variable.
Interactions with other medicines (* indicates severe):
	 Amikacin: increased risk of nephrotoxicity.
*	 Ciclosporin: increased risk of nephrotoxicity.
*	 Dexamethasone: increased risk of hypokalaemia (avoid concomitant use unless dexamethasone 

needed to control reactions).
*	 Digoxin: hypokalaemia caused by amphotericin B increases cardiac toxicity of digoxin.
	 Fluconazole: possible antagonism of effect of amphotericin B.
	 Flucytosine: renal excretion of flucytosine decreased and cellular uptake increased (flucytosine 

toxicity possibly increased).
	 Furosemide: increased risk of hypokalaemia.
	 Gentamicin: increased risk of nephrotoxicity.
	 Hydrochlorothiazide: increased risk of hypokalaemia.
*	 Hydrocortisone: increased risk of hypokalaemia (avoid concomitant use unless hydrocortisone 

needed to control reactions).
	 Miconazole: possible antagonism of effects of amphotericin B.
	 Paromomycin: possible increased risk of nephrotoxicity.
	 Pentamidine: possible increased risk of nephrotoxicity.
*	 Prednisolone: increased risk of hypokalaemia (avoid concomitant use unless prednisolone needed 

to control reactions).
	 Streptomycin: increased risk of nephrotoxicity.
	 Vancomycin: possible increased risk of nephrotoxicity.
Notes: Check renal function before starting treatment; monitor renal function and electrolytes 

(especially potassium, magnesium and sodium) at least three times weekly and complete blood 
picture and hepatic function twice weekly during treatment and until stable after treatment stops.

Prophylactic antipyretics or hydrocortisone should only be used in patients who have previously 
experienced acute adverse reactions (in whom continued treatment with amphotericin B is essential).

204	 WHO Model Formulary for Children 2010



6.5      Antiprotozoal medicines
Proper hydration and potassium supplementation are important. Treatment should always be given 

in hospital to enable continuous monitoring of patients.
Administration advice Incompatible with sodium chloride solutions, flush existing line with glucose 
5% or use a separate line.
Do not mix with any other drugs.
After initial reconstitution, do not administer without further dilution.
Conventional amphotericin B (as deoxycholate) Reduce risk of thrombophlebitis by using large peripheral veins 
or a central venous catheter, changing venous access sites frequently, and infusing over longer periods.
Reconstitute as per product instructions including further dilution with glucose 5% to produce a final 
concentration of 0.1 mg/ml (in fluid restricted children up to 0.4 mg/ml if given via a central line).
Initial test dose should be given over 20–30 minutes. To minimize infusion-related reactions, infuse the initial 
treatment dose slowly over 4–6 hours or continuously over 24 hours; tolerance to infusion reactions increases with 
subsequent doses, which may allow a shorter infusion, however, do not give over less than 2 hours.
Liposomal amphotericin B Reconstitute as per product instructions including filtering through a 5 micron filter 
and further dilute with glucose 5% to produce a final concentration of 0.2–2 mg/ml.
Initial test dose should be given over 10 minutes. Then infuse subsequent doses over 30–60 minutes.

Sodium stibogluconate or Meglumine antimoniate
ATC code: P01CB01; P01CB02

Sodium stibogluconate IV/IM injection: 100 mg of pentavalent antimony per ml
Meglumine antimoniate IV/IM injection: 81 mg of pentavalent antimony per ml

Sodium stibogluconate and meglumine antimoniate are not the same compound. Please ensure 
doses are calculated on the compound available.

Special Notes: Meglumine antimoniate and sodium stibogluconate are the pentavalent antimony 
compounds used to treat all forms of leishmaniasis. Both agents are similarly effective in 
leishmaniasis and their pharmacokinetics are similar.

Please be aware that the two compounds do not contain equivalent amounts of pentavalent 
antimony.

Meglumine antimoniate is also referred to as meglumine antimonate.
Indications: Visceral, cutaneous, mucocutaneous and post-kala-azar dermal leishmaniasis.
Contraindications: Pre-existing severe cardiac, liver, renal, pancreas or haematological morbidities; 

pregnancy.
206	 WHO Model Formulary for Children 2010



6.5      Antiprotozoal medicines
Precautions: Renal impairment; hepatic impairment.
Mucocutaneous disease Successful treatment of mucocutaneous leishmaniasis may induce severe 
inflammation around lesions (may be life threatening if pharyngeal or tracheal involvement), may require 
systemic corticosteroids.

Dose:
Doses are expressed in terms of pentavalent antimony.
Sodium stibogluconate IV/IM injection contains 100 mg of pentavalent antimony per ml.
Meglumine antimoniate IV/IM injection contains 81 mg of pentavalent antimony per ml.
Visceral leishmaniasis. 

IV/IM: 
Child all ages 20 mg/kg (minimum 200 mg) daily for 28 days in L. infantum infections and for 
30 days in L. donovani infections.

Post-kala-azar dermal leishmaniasis. 
IV/IM: 
Child all ages 20 mg/kg (minimum 200 mg) daily for 30–60 days.

Cutaneous leishmaniasis. 
Intralesional: 
Child all ages 1–5 ml per session, every 3–7 days (1–5 infiltrations). 
Systemic treatment is acceptable if the patient suffers from numerous lesions (typically greater 
than four), face-disfiguring or complicated lesion(s), if the size or localization of the lesion 
makes local therapy impossible, or if local therapy has been tried and failed. For diffuse 
cutaneous forms by L. aethiopica, the addition of paromomycin may be necessary.  
IV/IM: 
Child all ages 20 mg/kg daily for 10–20 days.

Mucocutaneous leishmaniasis. 
 IM/IV: 
Child all ages 20 mg/kg daily for 30 days.

Renal impairment: Moderate: increased adverse effects.
Severe: contraindicated.
Hepatic impairment: Mild to moderate impairment: use with caution; increased risk of liver damage 

and hepatic failure.
Adverse effects: Common Anorexia, vomiting, nausea, abdominal pain, malaise, myalgia, arthralgia, 

headache, metallic taste, lethargy, elevated pancreatic and liver enzymes, leukopenia, anaemia, 
thrombocytopenia.

Rare Cardiotoxicity and sudden death (see below), hepatotoxicity, pancreatitis, flushing, bleeding 
from nose or gum, vertigo, fever, sweating, rash, anaphylaxis, pain and thrombosis on intravenous 
administration, pain on intramuscular injection, renal impairment and/or damage, peripheral 
neuropathy, substernal pain or cough.

Cardiotoxicity Electrocardiographic changes are dependent on dose and duration of treatment, the most 
common being T-wave inversion, prolonged QT interval and arrhythmias. Cardiotoxicity and sudden deaths are 
serious but uncommon side-effects. Prolongation of corrected QT interval (greater than 0.5 seconds) signals the 
likely onset of serious and potentially fatal cardiac arrhythmias or death.
Interactions with other medicines (* indicates severe):
	 Furosemide: increased risk of toxicity.
	 Vancomycin: increased risk of toxicity.
	 Cisplatin: increased risk of toxicity.

WHO Model Formulary for Children 2010	 207



6	 Anti-infective medicines
	 Amphotericin B: possibly increased risk of nephrotoxicity.
*	 Pyridostigmine: possible antagonism.
*	 Neostigmine: possible antagonism.
*	 Suxamethonium: possibly enhanced effects of suxamethonium.
Notes: Monitoring of patients with serum chemistry, complete blood count and electrocardiography 

should be done. The quality of pentavalent antimonials should be assured. Substandard drugs 
are known to cause severe toxicity and death. If serious side-effects arise (in most cases related to 
hepato- and cardiotoxicity), the treatment should be changed to another drug.

Ampoules should be stored in well-closed containers, protected from light. It should be noted that 
antimonial compounds are polymers that may deteriorate with age.

Administration The injection should be filtered immediately before administration using a 5 micron or less 
filter. Intravenous injection should be given either by infusion (over 5–10 minutes) or slow injection through a fine 
needle (23–25 gauge; 0.6–0.5 mm) to avoid any risk of subsequent thrombosis. Intramuscular injection should be 
given deep into the muscle. If the volume of injection exceeds a suitable size for the patient, it should be divided into 
two doses; one in each buttock or thigh. Infusions should be ceased if coughing or substernal pain occurs.

6.5.3	 Antimalarial medicines

6.5.3.1	 For curative treatment
Malaria, which is transmitted by anopheline mosquitoes, is caused by four species of plasmodial 
parasites. Plasmodium vivax is extensively distributed. P. falciparum is also widespread, and causes the 
most severe infections, which are responsible for nearly all malaria-related deaths. P. ovale is mainly 
confined to Africa and is less prevalent, while P. malariae, which causes the least severe but most 
persistent infections, also occurs widely.
Certain tissue forms of P. vivax and P. ovale, which can persist in the liver for many months, and 
sometimes years, are responsible for relapses. Such latent forms are not generated by P. falciparum 
or P. malariae. Recrudescence of these infections results from persistent blood forms in inadequately 
treated or untreated patients.
The following recent key recommendations regarding antimalarial therapy have been endorsed:
First-line treatment for malaria should be with combinations of medicines rather than single drug therapy.
•	 Artemisinin-containing combination therapy (ACT) is recommended as first-line curative  

treatment for uncomplicated malaria.
Treatment of severe falciparum malaria requires parenteral therapy. Parenteral antimalarials are also 
used to initiate treatment in patients unable to take oral treatment.

6.5.3.2	 For prophylaxis
No drug regimen gives assured protection to everybody, and indiscriminate use of antimalarials can 
increase the risk of inducing resistance. Avoidance of mosquito bites using insect repellents, mosquito 
nets (preferably impregnated with an insecticide), long pants and long-sleeved shirts, and door and 
window screens are important preventative strategies.
Current guidelines should be consulted to inform management of malaria, for example, the WHO 
guidelines for the treatment of malaria.

6.5.4	 Antipneumocystosis and antitoxoplasmosis 
medicines

Pneumocystosis
Pneumocystis jiroveci (Pneumocystis carinii) is classified as a protozoan which in otherwise healthy 
people rarely produces signs of infection. However, it is a frequent cause of opportunistic infection in 
immunosuppressed, debilitated or malnourished patients. P. jiroveci (P. carinii) is a common cause of 
pneumonia in people with AIDS, and the most frequent immediate cause of death in these patients.
Sulfamethoxazole + trimethoprim (co-trimoxazole) is the treatment of choice for P. jiroveci (P. 
carinii) pneumonia; it is also used for prophylaxis in HIV-infected, HIV-exposed and other immuno-
compromised children. Refer to the WHO guidelines Co-trimoxazole prophylaxis for HIV-exposed and 
HIV-infected infants and children (available from https://www.who.int/hiv/pub/paediatric/en/).

Toxoplasmosis
Toxoplasmosis is caused by infection with the protozoan parasite, Toxoplasma gondii. Most infections 
are self-limiting and do not require treatment. However, in immunodeficiency, primary infection may 
result in encephalitis, myocarditis or pneumonitis. Impairment of immunity (e.g. in people with AIDS) 
in a previously infected person may cause reactivation, resulting in encephalitis or meningoencephalitis. 
The treatment of choice for toxoplasmosis is a combination of pyrimethamine and sulfadiazine; a 
folate supplement is also given to counteract the inhibition of folate synthesis associated with these 
drugs.

Pyrimethamine
ATC code: P01BD01

Tablet: 25 mg
Indications: Treatment and prophylaxis of toxoplasmosis; prophylaxis of Pneumocystis jiroveci 

(Pneumocystis carinii) pneumonia.
Local antimicrobial sensitivity patterns need to be taken into account. Expert advice essential.
Contraindications: Megaloblastic anaemia.
Precautions: Folate deficiency; blood counts required with prolonged treatment; supplement folate 

throughout treatment to prevent haematological toxicity; history of seizures (avoid large loading 
doses); renal impairment; hepatic impairment.

WHO Model Formulary for Children 2010	 225



6	 Anti-infective medicines

Dose:
Note Calcium folinate must always be administered with pyrimethamine to prevent haematological toxicity. 
Due to the long half-life of pyrimethamine, calcium folinate administration should be continued for 1 week 
after pyrimethamine has been discontinued.
Treatment of congenital toxoplasmosis (in combination with sulfadiazine and calcium folinate).  

Oral:   
Neonate 1 mg/kg twice daily for 2 days, then 1 mg/kg once daily for 6 months, then 1 mg/

6.5.5	 Antitrypanosomal medicines

6.5.5.1	 African trypanosomiasis
African trypanosomiasis, or sleeping sickness, is a protozoan infection which is transmitted by 
Glossina spp. (tsetse flies). Two subspecies of Trypanosoma brucei (T. brucei gambiense and T. brucei 
rhodesiense) produce distinctive clinical forms of the disease. T. brucei gambiense infection constitutes 
95% of all human African trypanosomiasis cases. The early stage of African trypanosomiasis results 
from infection of the blood stream and lymph nodes. The second meningoencephalitic stage results 
from infection of the central nervous system. Signs of the later stage develop within a few weeks in  
T. brucei rhodesiense infection but only after several months or years in T. brucei gambiense infection.

First-stage disease
Treatment of early-stage infections of T. brucei rhodesiense with suramin sodium and T. brucei 
gambiense with pentamidine can be curative if started before the central nervous system has become 
involved.

Second-stage disease
Eflornithine and melarsoprol are used for the treatment of second-stage (neurological) trypanosomal 
infections, since both medications reach therapeutic levels in the central nervous system.
Following treatment of African trypanosomiasis, patients should be followed up at 6-monthly  
intervals for 24 months. Monitoring of leukocytes, total protein content and trypanosome presence 
in cerebrospinal fluid is recommended in order to evaluate treatment efficacy.

Eflornithine
ATC code: P01CX03

Injection: 200 mg (hydrochloride)/ml in 100 ml bottle

Iatrogenic mortality from 0.7–2%.
Reactions requiring immediate corrective measures and withdrawal of treatment include severe 
anaemia (8 g/dl), leukopenia (< 1000 cells/mm3), thrombocytopenia (< 20 000 cells/mm3).
Eflornithine is a toxic drug. Adverse effects occur frequently during its use, and are sometimes 
fatal. Eflornithine should therefore be used only for approved indications where close 
observation can be maintained.

Special Notes: Also referred to as (alpha)-difluoromethylornithine and DFMO.
Medicine for the treatment of second-stage African trypanosomiasis.
230	 WHO Model Formulary for Children 2010



6.5      Antiprotozoal medicines
Indications: Treatment of second-stage Trypanosoma brucei gambiense infection.
Contraindications: Ineffective in the treatment of Trypanosoma brucei rhodesiense human African 

trypanosomiasis.
Precautions: Hospitalization and close supervision throughout treatment; renal impairment; monitor 

complete blood and platelet counts for bone marrow suppression (severe anaemia, leukopenia or 
thrombocytopenia requires an interruption in treatment until there is evidence of bone marrow 
recovery); concurrent bacterial infections.

Dose:
Treatment of second-stage Trypanosoma brucei gambiense infection.  

Slow IV infusion:  
Child under 35 kg 150 mg/kg over 2 hours every 6 hours for 14 days;  
over 35 kg 100 mg/kg over 2 hours every 6 hours for 14 days. 

Note These doses are based on clinical experience and limited evidence.
Renal impairment: Dosage adjustment may be required in all degrees of renal impairment. 

Eflornithine is 80% renally excreted.
Adverse effects: Common Diarrhoea, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, tremor, dizziness, 

confusion, seizures, injection site reaction, anaemia, leukopenia, thrombocytopenia.
Uncommon Anorexia, headache, oedema, bacterial infection at the catheter site with risk of phlebitis, 

cellulitis, pyomyositis and generalized sepsis, death.
Rare Alopecia, pruritus, muscle pain, eosinophilia, impaired hearing (usually with longer courses 

used for cancer treatment).
Interactions with other medicines (* indicates severe):
There are no known interactions where it is recommended to avoid concurrent use.
Notes: Eflornithine hydrochloride concentrate for injection is hypertonic and must be diluted with 

sterile water for injection before infusion.
After dilution with sterile water for injection, eflornithine must be used within 24 hours. Bags 

containing diluted eflornithine should be stored at 4 °C (39 °F) to minimize the risk of microbial 
proliferation.

Strict aseptic technique should be used when administering, with frequent replacement of IV 
cannulas (at least every 2 days).

Monitoring should continue for up to 4 weeks after finishing treatment.
Eflornithine in combination with nifurtimox has been recently introduced to reduce duration and 

workload of eflornithine monotherapy and may delay the appearance of drug resistance. Currently, 
there is a multicentre trial being conducted which includes assessing the safety and efficacy in 
children at the same dose as adults.

Melarsoprol
ATC code: P01CD01

Injection: 36 mg/ml (3.6%) solution, 5 ml ampoule (180 mg of active compound)

Melarsoprol is very toxic with a 3–10% lethality. It should therefore be used only for the 
approved indications where close observation can be maintained and it can be administered by 
experienced personnel. Melarsoprol is strictly for intravenous use only.

Special Notes: Also referred to as Mel B or Melarsen Oxide-BAL.
Treatment of second-stage African trypanosomiasis.
Indications: Treatment of second-stage Trypanosoma brucei rhodesiense or Trypanosoma brucei 

gambiense infection.
Contraindications: Ingestion of alcohol during treatment.
Precautions: Hospitalization and close medical supervision required throughout treatment; reactive 

encephalopathy (immediate treatment suspension essential); treat intercurrent infections such as 
pneumonia and malaria before melarsoprol administration; malnutrition (if possible, correct with 
protein-rich diet); G6PD deficiency; leprosy (may precipitate erythema nodosum); fever; avoid use 
during influenza epidemics (increased risk of reactive encephalopathy in febrile patients); avoid 
extravasation. 

Dose:
Treatment of second-stage Trypanosoma brucei rhodesiense infection.  

Slow IV infusion:  
Child all ages dose gradually increased from 1.2 mg/kg to maximum of 3.6 mg/kg daily in 
courses of 3–4 days with intervals of 7–10 days between courses. 

Treatment of second-stage Trypanosoma brucei gambiense infection.  
Slow IV infusion:  
Child all ages 2.2 mg/kg daily for 10 days. 

Note Prednisolone 1 mg/kg once daily should be administered concurrently to all patients for the duration 
of melarsoprol therapy.

Adverse effects: Common Fatal reactive encephalopathy (see below), peripheral neuropathy, Jarisch-
Herxheimer reaction (fever and chills may also occur, resulting from trypanosome destruction), 
headache, diarrhoea, vomiting, arthralgia, fever, skin reactions, thrombophlebitis.

Reactive encephalopathy appears to be more frequent in children.
Uncommon Myocardial damage, albuminuria, hypertension, hyperthermia, urticaria.
Rare Agranulocytosis, aplastic anaemia, thrombocytopenia, hypersensitivity reactions (especially on 

second or subsequent doses), haemorrhagic encephalopathy, exfoliative dermatitis.
Fatal reactive encephalopathy Also known as “arsenical encephalopathy”, is characterized by 
fever, headache, tremor, slurred speech, seizures and ultimately coma (occurs in 3–10% of patients treated with 
melarsoprol, and is fatal in approximately 50% of those who experience it).

232	 WHO Model Formulary for Children 2010



6.5      Antiprotozoal medicines
Interactions with other medicines (* indicates severe):
	 Alcohol: combination contraindicated as increases toxicity of melarsoprol.
Notes: Relapse has been reported in up to 20–30% of late-stage trypanosomiasis patients after 

treatment with melarsoprol. This appears related to resistance, although reinfection or inadequate 
CSF concentrations of the drug may be responsible in some cases. Re-treatment with melarsoprol 
in these patients has not been consistently effective and is not recommended. Eflornithine therapy 
should be considered.

Patients should remain supine and fasting for at least 2 hours after injection to reduce gastrointestinal 
side-effects.

Administration Melarsoprol should be administered by slow intravenous injection as a 3.6% solution in 
propylene glycol. Because melarsoprol injection is intensely irritating due to its propylene glycol content, care 
should be taken to avoid leakage into the surrounding tissues. Extravasation during intravenous administration 
may result in extreme local tissue damage and destruction.

Pentamidine
ATC code: P01CX01

Powder for injection: 300 mg (pentamidine isetionate) in vial

Pentamidine isetionate is toxic and personnel should be adequately protected during handling 
and administration; consult product literature.
Severe, sometimes fatal, hypotension, hypoglycaemia, pancreatitis and cardiac arrhythmias 
have been reported. Other life-threatening reactions requiring immediate corrective measures 
and withdrawal of treatment have included leukopenia (< 1000 cells/mm3), thrombocytopenia 
(< 20 000 cells/mm3), acute renal failure, hypocalcaemia and ventricular tachycardia.
Fatalities have been documented following pentamidine administration. The ratio of therapeutic 
to toxic dose of pentamidine is very low and adverse effects, some of which may be life 
threatening, occur frequently during its use. Pentamidine should, therefore, be used only for the 
approved indications where close observation can be maintained.

Special Notes: Medicine for the treatment of first-stage African trypanosomiasis. 
The WHO Model List of Essential Medicines for Children 2009 has the 200 mg vial listed. This 

strength is no longer in production and a 300 mg vial is available.
Indications: Treatment of first-stage Trypanosoma brucei gambiense infection.

6	 Anti-infective medicines
Precautions: Cerebrospinal fluid examination before treatment (pentamidine not likely to be 

effective if leukocyte count greater than 5–10 cells/mm3, or trypanosomes detected in cerebrospinal 
fluid); risk of severe hypotension following administration; hypotension or hypertension; hepatic 
impairment; hypoglycaemia or hyperglycaemia; leukopenia; thrombocytopenia; anaemia; 
immunodeficiency (if acute deterioration in bone marrow, renal or pancreatic function, interrupt 
or discontinue treatment); renal impairment.

Dose:
Treatment of first-stage T. brucei gambiense infection.  

IM:   
Infant or Child 4 mg/kg daily for 7 days.

Renal impairment: Severe impairment: reduce dose interval (e.g. every alternate day).
Hepatic impairment: Use with caution.
Adverse effects: Common Pain at injection site.
Rare Diarrhoea, nausea, nephrotoxicity, acute hypotension, hypoglycaemia (may be followed by 

hyperglycaemia and type I diabetes mellitus), pancreatitis; also hypocalcaemia, gastrointestinal 
disturbances, confusion, hallucinations, arrhythmias, thrombocytopenia, leukopenia, abnormal 
liver function tests, anaemia, hyperkalaemia, rash, Stevens-Johnson syndrome; pain, local 
induration, sterile abscess and muscle necrosis at injection site.

Interactions with other medicines (* indicates severe):
	 Amphotericin B: possibly increased risk of nephrotoxicity.
	 Artemether: increased level and toxicity of pentamidine. Avoid concomitant use.  
	 Quinine: increased level and toxicity of pentamidine and quinine. Avoid concomitant use.
	 Typhoid vaccine: pentamidine may decrease the effect of typhoid vaccine. 
Notes: A cerebrospinal fluid examination before treatment is required as pentamidine is not effective 

if trypanosomes are detected in the cerebrospinal fluid or the leukocyte count is above 5–10 cells/mm3.
Before administration, establish baseline blood pressure and administer with patient lying down; they 

should remain lying for 1–2 hours after administration.
Monitor blood pressure and cardiac rhythm during administration and treatment period.
Hypoglycaemia post-administration is easily prevented by administering oral sugar, in tea or similar, 

half an hour before administration.
Periodic ECG is desirable.
Extreme care should be taken to ensure aseptic technique when administering to avoid the risk of 

abscess or necrosis at the injection site.
Reconstitution and administration Reconstitute vial with water for injection to a final 
concentration of 100 mg/ml. Administer by deep intramuscular injection and preferably into the buttock. 
Pentamidine isetionate is toxic; care is required to protect personnel during handling and administration.

6.5      Antiprotozoal medicines

Suramin sodium
ATC code: P01CX02

Powder for injection: 1 g in vial

A potentially fatal immediate hypersensitivity reaction is estimated to occur in 1 per 20 000 
patients; a test dose is recommended before starting treatment. Suramin sodium should only be 
administered by experienced staff.

Special Notes: Medicine for the treatment of first-stage African trypanosomiasis.
Indications: Treatment of the initial phase of Trypanosoma brucei rhodesiense infection.
Contraindications: Previous anaphylaxis or suramin sensitivity; severe liver impairment; severe renal 

impairment.
Precautions: Debilitated or malnourished patients; albuminuria; onchocerciasis.

Dose:
Treatment of the initial phase of Trypanosoma brucei rhodesiense infection. 

Slow IV injection:  
Child all ages 5 mg/kg on day 1 (as a test dose) followed by 20 mg/kg on day 3, 10, 17, 24 and 31.

First (test) dose Administer first dose with particular caution; wait at least 1 minute after injecting the first 
few microlitres; inject next 0.5 ml over 30 seconds and wait 1 minute; inject the remainder over several minutes.

Renal impairment: Mild to moderate impairment: use with caution.
Severe impairment: avoid use.
Suramin is excreted renally at a slow rate due to extensive protein binding. Drug can be excreted in 

the urine unchanged for 3 months following doses of suramin.
Hepatic impairment: Severe impairment: avoid use. Administration of suramin in individuals with 

significant hepatic dysfunction, in whom serum albumin levels may be reduced, may result in 
toxic serum suramin levels due to an increased free fraction of the drug in the plasma.

Adverse effects: Common Fever, rash, vomiting, nausea and metallic taste, thrombocytopenia, 
peripheral neuropathy, transient hyperbilirubinaemia, mild proteinuria.

Rare Immediate and potentially fatal allergic reaction with nausea, vomiting, shock and loss of 
consciousness during first dose (see First (test) dose), albuminuria, abdominal pain, severe 
diarrhoea, stomal ulceration, exfoliative dermatitis, tiredness, anorexia, malaise, polyuria, thirst, 
raised liver enzyme values, paraesthesia and hyperaesthesia of palms and soles.

Interactions with other medicines (* indicates severe):
There are no known interactions where it is recommended to avoid concurrent use.
Notes: Suramin is only effective in the early stages of the illness, in which no CNS involvement has 

occurred. Suramin crosses the blood-brain barrier poorly, and in later stages where the organism 
has penetrated the CNS, other agents must be used.

Cerebrospinal fluid examination should be conducted before treatment.
Administer only under close medical supervision in hospital and with general condition improved as 

far as possible before treatments.
Poor nutritional status increases frequency of adverse reactions, so correct with a protein-rich diet 

and maintain satisfactory food and fluid intake during treatment.
Conduct urine tests before treatment and weekly during treatment; reduce dose if moderate 

albuminuria, discontinue immediately if severe albuminuria or casts in urine.
Reconstitution of injection Reconstitute in water for injections to produce a final concentration of 
10%. The compound deteriorates quickly in air and so should be injected immediately after preparation.

6.5.5.2	 American trypanosomiasis
Chagas disease is a disease caused by the parasite T. cruzi. It is transmitted to humans by insect vectors 
that are found only in the Americas (mainly in rural areas of Latin America where poverty is widespread).
Chagas disease has an acute and a chronic phase. If Chagas disease is not treated, infection is lifelong.
The acute illness (which occurs immediately after inoculation and lasts weeks to months) may be 
mild or asymptomatic. Symptoms include fever or swelling at the inoculation site.
After this, most people enter a chronic phase, during which most people are asymptomatic. Approximately 
30% will develop serious complications including cardiac and gastrointestinal manifestations of the 
disease. In people with immunosuppresssion (e.g. HIV/AIDS), Chagas disease can reactivate and 
potentially cause severe disease.

7	 Antimigraine medicines

7	 Antimigraine medicines
Migraine is the most common identifiable cause of recurrent or chronic headache in childhood. Prior 
to diagnosing migraine in a child, alternative causes of headache including raised intracranial pressure 
(e.g. due to a space-occupying lesion or meningitis) or systemic illness must also be considered. A 
careful history, examination and follow-up help guide the correct diagnosis.
In children, the presentation of migraine is influenced by the age of the child, but is characterized 
by periodic episodes of paroxysmal headache often accompanied by pallor, nausea, vomiting and 
relief with sleep. Migraines with aura or prolonged neurological symptoms are uncommon in young 
children. In adolescents, the presentation of migraine is often similar to that of adults.
The following features are suggestive of an alternative diagnosis or possible intracranial pathology 
warranting further investigation or referral:
•	 recurrent early morning headaches
•	 headaches that are prolonged and incapacitating
•	 progressive change in personality or behaviour
•	 abnormal neurological examination findings
•	 failure to respond to usual treatment measures.
Treatment of migraine in children consists of three components: general measures, acute measures, 
and, in some cases, preventive treatment. General measures include appropriate reassurance and 
avoidance of any identified trigger factors.

7.1      For treatment of acute attack
For treatment of an acute attack early use of simple analgesics are often effective.

(increased risk of renal impairment); concomitant use of drugs that increase risk of bleeding; 
previous peptic ulceration; dehydration; coagulation defects; allergic disorders; renal impairment; 
hepatic impairment.

Dose:
Treatment of acute migraine attack.  

Oral: 
Infant or Child over 3 months 5–10 mg/kg three or four times daily with or after food.

medicines used in palliative care

8.1      Immunosuppressive medicines
NOTE. WHO advises that this class of drugs is for use only when adequate resources and specialist care are 
available. Specific expertise, diagnostic precision, individualization of dosage and special equipment are 
required for their proper use.
Immunosuppressive drugs are used in organ transplant recipients to suppress rejection; they are also 
used as second-line drugs in chronic inflammatory conditions. Treatment should only be initiated by 
a specialist. Careful monitoring of blood counts is required in patients receiving immunosuppressive 
drugs, and the dose should be adjusted to prevent bone marrow toxicity. Immunosuppressed patients 
are particularly prone to atypical infections.

Azathioprine
ATC code: L04AX01

Powder for injection: 100 mg (as sodium salt) in vial
Tablet: 50 mg

Special Notes: Also referred to as AZT (Note: this abbreviation is also used for zidovudine).
Indications: To prevent rejection in organ transplant recipients in combination with other 

medications.
Contraindications: Hypersensitivity to azathioprine or mercaptopurine.
Precautions: Liver disease; renal impairment. Monitor for toxicity throughout treatment; full 

blood counts necessary every week (or more frequently with higher doses and in renal or hepatic 
impairment) for first 4 weeks of treatment, and at least every 3 months thereafter.

Patients with genetic deficiency of the enzyme thiopurine methyltransferase (TPMT) which 
metabolizes azathioprine are at greater risk of myelosuppressive effects.

Bone marrow suppression Patients should be warned to report immediately any signs or symptoms of 
bone marrow suppression, for example unexplained bruising or bleeding, infection.

Dose:
Organ transplantation.  

Oral or IV:  
Child 1 month–12 years initially 3–5 mg/kg once daily beginning at the time of transplant; 
maintenance 1–3 mg/kg once daily, adjusted according to response. Total daily dose may 
alternatively be given in two divided doses.

Renal impairment: Mild: dose as in normal renal function.
Moderate: 75–100% of normal dose.
Severe: 50–100% of normal dose.
Hepatic impairment: May need dose reduction.
Adverse effects: Common Leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, anaemia, increased susceptibility to 

infections due to immunosuppression, alopecia, diarrhoea, anorexia, nausea and vomiting, mouth 
ulcers, oesophagitis.

Uncommon Hepatitis, photosensitivity.

246	 WHO Model Formulary for Children 2010



8.1      Immunosuppressive medicines
Rare Hepatic veno-occlusive disease, hypersensitivity reactions, malaise, dizziness, fever, muscular 

pains, arthralgia, rash, hypotension or interstitial nephritis call for immediate withdrawal, 
cholestatic jaundice, colitis in patients also receiving corticosteroids, pancreatitis, pneumonitis, 
increased incidence of malignancies and lymphoproliferative disorders.

Interactions with other medicines (* indicates severe):
*	 Allopurinol: effects of azathioprine enhanced and toxicity increased, reduce dose of azathioprine.
	 Phenytoin: possibly reduced absorption of phenytoin.
*	 Sulfamethoxazole + trimethoprim: increased risk of haematological toxicity.
*	 Trimethoprim: increased risk of haematological toxicity.
*	 Vaccine, live: avoid use of live vaccines with azathioprine (impairment of immune response).
*	 Warfarin: anticoagulant effect possibly reduced.
Notes: Intravenous injection is alkaline and very irritant; the intravenous route should therefore only 

be used if oral administration is not possible. For intravenous injection give over at least 1 minute. 
For intravenous infusion dilute to a concentration of 0.25–2.5 mg/ml in glucose 5% or sodium 
chloride 0.9% or sodium chloride and glucose; give over 30–60 minutes.

Patient information Patients should be warned to report immediately any signs or symptoms of bone 
marrow suppression, for example unexplained bruising or bleeding, infection.
Specific expertise, diagnostic precision, individualization of dosage or special equipment required for 

proper use.
Hazardous agent Azathioprine is an immunosuppressive agent. Use appropriate precautions for handling 
and disposal.

Capsule: 25 mg
Concentrate for injection: 50 mg/ml in 1 ml ampoule for organ transplantation

Special Notes: Also referred to as cyclosporine.
Indications: For use in organ transplant recipients in kidney, liver, heart or bone marrow 

transplantation, graft-versus-host disease and nephrotic syndrome.
Contraindications: Hypersensitivity to ciclosporin or any component of formulations (e.g. polyoxyl 

35 castor oil in injection or polyoxyl 40 hydrogenated castor oil in capsules); breastfeeding.
Precautions: Monitor kidney function (dose-dependent increase in serum creatinine and urea 

during first few weeks may necessitate dose reduction, exclude rejection if kidney transplant); 
monitor liver function (adjust dosage according to bilirubin and liver enzymes); monitor blood 
pressure (discontinue if hypertension cannot be controlled by antihypertensives); monitor 
serum potassium, particularly if marked renal impairment (risk of hyperkalaemia); monitor 
serum magnesium; hyperuricaemia; measure blood lipids before and during treatment; avoid in 
porphyria.

Additional cautions in nephrotic syndrome Reduce dose by 25–50% if serum creatinine 
more than 30% above baseline at more than one measurement; perform renal biopsies at yearly intervals; 
contraindicated in uncontrolled infections and malignancy.

Dose:
Note Lower doses are required when ciclosporin is used with other immunosuppressants.
Serum level monitoring is required, a guide (based on adult recommendations) is provided in 

Notes, however, specialist transplant protocols should be consulted.
Solid organ transplantation.  

Oral:  
Child over 3 months 10–15 mg/kg 4–12 hours before surgery, then 10–15 mg/kg/day in 
1–2 doses for 1–2 weeks, reducing to 2–6 mg/kg/day in 1–2 doses for maintenance (adjust dose 
according to blood ciclosporin concentration and kidney function). 
IV:  
Child over 3 months 3–5 mg/kg 4–12 hours before surgery, then 3–5 mg/kg/day in 1–2 doses 
for 1–2 weeks, reducing to 0.6–2 mg/kg/day for maintenance (adjust dose according to blood 
ciclosporin concentration and kidney function).

Bone marrow transplantation or graft-versus-host disease (GVHD).  
Oral:  
Child over 3 months 12.5–15 mg/kg daily for 2 weeks, starting on day before transplantation 
(or at the onset of GVHD), followed by 12.5 mg/kg/day in 1–2 doses for 3–6 months, then 
gradually tailed off (may take up to 1 year after transplant). 
IV:  
Child over 3 months 3–5 mg/kg/day in 1–2 doses for 2 weeks, starting on the day before 
transplantation (or at the onset of GVHD), followed by oral maintenance doses.

Notes: Conversion Any conversion between brands should be undertaken very carefully, and the 
manufacturer’s product information consulted for further advice.
Note Concentrate for infusion may contain polyethoxylated castor oil, which has been associated with 
anaphylaxis; observe patient for 30 minutes after starting infusion and then at frequent intervals.
Serum concentration monitoring Draw blood for ciclosporin measurement by venepuncture, 
not from a central line.
Avoid using nonspecific assays which measure ciclosporin plus metabolites. Concentrations obtained from 
nonspecific assays are not interchangeable with the results from a specific assay.
The ciclosporin concentration 2 hours after a dose (C2) correlates better with area under the curve (AUC) than 
the 12 hour trough concentration (C0). There is evidence to suggest that C2 is a better indicator of adequate 
immunosuppression.
The following concentrations are a guide. They depend on assay technique, transplant type, time since transplant 
and use of other immunosuppressants. Aim for higher concentrations in the first 3 months after transplant and 
where rejection has occurred and lower concentrations where adverse effects are experienced.
Trough concentrations (C0) Whole blood specific assay, 100–300 micrograms/l.
C2 concentrations Collect sample 2 hours (± 15 minutes) after a dose of ciclosporin.
Recommended C2 whole blood concentrations for Neoral® brand in adults Liver transplant: 600–
1000 micrograms/l.
Kidney transplant: 800–1500 micrograms/l.
Continuous IV infusion Whole blood specific assay, 300–500 micrograms/l.
Consult local protocols or specialist advice for use in children.
Intravenous administration advice Dilute injection to 1:20 to 1:100 in glucose 5% or sodium 
chloride 0.9%; infuse IV over 2–6 hours (more slowly if facial flushing occurs); use a glass bottle and non-PVC 
administration set to avoid phthalate stripping and use short giving sets to reduce amount adsorbed.
Patient information Swallow capsules whole and take them 12 hours apart at the same times each day.
Clean your teeth and gums regularly.
Hazardous agent Ciclosporin is an immunosuppressive agent. Use appropriate precautions for handling 
and disposal.

8.2      Cytotoxic medicines

8.2      Cytotoxic medicines
NOTE. WHO advises that while cytotoxic medicines are essential for the treatment of malignancy in 
children, adequate resources and specialist supervision are a prerequisite for the introduction of this class 
of drugs. Specific expertise, diagnostic precision, individualization of dosage and special equipment are 
required for their proper use. There are many differences in the spectrum and management of childhood 
cancers, compared to adult cancers, and the treatment of malignancy in children with drugs, radiotherapy 
and surgery is complex and should only be undertaken by specialists in this field. For this reason, the  
following information is provided merely as a guide.
Chemotherapy may be curative or used to alleviate symptoms or prolong life (palliative). When the 
condition can no longer be managed with cytotoxic therapy, alternative palliative treatment (section 
8.4) should be considered.
For some tumours, single-drug chemotherapy may be adequate, but for most malignancies, a 
combination of drugs provides the best response; specialist literature should be consulted. Cytotoxic 
drugs are often combined with other classes of drugs in the treatment of malignant conditions. Such 
drugs include hormone agonists and antagonists, corticosteroids and immunosuppressant drugs  
(section 8.3). Combinations are, however, more toxic than single drugs.
Cytotoxic medications should be used with great care and close monitoring. Specific doses and  
details of contraindications, precautions and adverse effects for the individual cytotoxic drugs have 
been omitted in the following section since treatment should be undertaken by specialists using  
approved regimens; specialist literature should be consulted for further information.

Adverse effects
Cytotoxic drugs have a considerable potential to damage normal tissue. Specific adverse effects apply, 
but a number are common to all cytotoxics, such as bone marrow and immunological suppression. 
The concomitant use of immunosuppressive drugs will enhance susceptibility to infections. Fever 
associated with neutropenia requires immediate treatment with antibiotics.
Nausea and vomiting following administration of cytotoxic drugs and abdominal radiotherapy are 
often distressing and may compromise further treatment. Symptoms may be acute (occurring within 
24 hours of treatment), delayed (first occurring more than 24 hours after treatment) or anticipatory 
(occurring before subsequent doses). Antiemetic medicines are further discussed in section 17.2.
Hyperuricaemia may complicate treatment of conditions such as non-Hodgkin lymphomas and 
leukaemia. Renal damage may result from the formation of uric acid crystals. Patients should be 
adequately hydrated, and hyperuricaemia may be managed with allopurinol.
Alopecia is common during treatment with cytotoxic drugs. There is no drug treatment, but the 
condition often reverses spontaneously once treatment has stopped.
Oral mucositis is common during cancer chemotherapy, particularly with fluorouracil, methotrexate 
and anthracyclines. Prevention of a sore mouth is important, because once it has developed treatment  
is much less effective. Brushing teeth with a soft brush two to three times daily and rinsing the 
mouth frequently are probably the most effective preventative measures. Treatment involves regular 
use of saline mouthwashes. Generally mucositis is self-limiting, but it can be a focus for blood-borne 
infection in the absence of good oral hygiene. Any pain caused by mucositis should be dealt with 
effectively.

Asparaginase
ATC code: L01XX02

Powder for injection: 10 000 IU in vial

Allergic reactions to asparaginase are frequent and can be fatal. Risk factors include intravenous 
administration, large doses, prior exposure to asparaginase and intervals of even a few days 
between doses. An intradermal test dose may be administered (see Precautions).

Special Notes: Also referred to as crisantaspase, L-asparaginase and colaspase.
Different brands of asparaginase may not be interchangeable and the units may be expressed 

differently.
Indications: Acute lymphoblastic leukaemia; T-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma.
Contraindications: Allergy to asparaginase; history of pancreatitis; history of thrombosis or 

haemorrhagic events with previous asparaginase therapy; pregnancy.
Precautions: Underlying coagulopathy; impaired renal function; pre-existing liver impairment; 

discontinue at the first sign of renal failure or pancreatitis; appropriate measures should be taken 
to prevent hyperuricaemia and uric acid nephropathy (consider allopurinol, hydration and urinary 
alkalinization); test dose recommended (see below).

Test dose An intradermal test dose of 2 international units is often recommended prior to the first dose of 
asparaginase or prior to restarting therapy after a hiatus of several days. However, false negative rates of up to 80% 
are reported. Serious allergic reactions can occur; intradermal testing should only be done in a hospital setting 
with adequate monitoring and resuscitation facilities. Desensitization may be performed in patients who are 
found to be hypersensitive from the intradermal test dose; consult specialist texts for details.

Dose:
See specialist treatment protocols.

Renal impairment: Use with caution.
Hepatic impairment: Use with caution.
Adverse effects: Children appear to tolerate asparaginase better than adults.
Common Allergic reactions, nausea, vomiting, fatty changes in the liver, elevated transaminases and 

bilirubin, decreased albumin and calcium concentrations, reduced fibrinogen and clotting factors 
(resulting in prolonged clotting times), uraemia, pancreatitis.

Uncommon Transient proteinuria, hyperglycaemia (rarely leading to diabetic ketoacidosis), CNS 
effects including depression or hyperexcitability, chills and fever (possibly caused by bacterial 
endotoxins in the preparation), increased fibrin degradation products, increased blood ammonia.

Rare Intracranial haemorrhage or thrombosis, peripheral venous and arterial thrombosis, transient 
myelosuppression, acute renal failure, Parkinsonian-like syndrome, diarrhoea, oral mucositis.

Interactions with other medicines (* indicates severe):
	 Vaccines, live: avoid use of live vaccines with asparaginase (impairment of immune response).
	 Cytarabine: decreased antineoplastic effect if given prior to cytarabine.
	 Methotrexate: decreased antineoplastic effect if given prior to methotrexate.
	 Prednisolone: increased hyperglycaemic effect.

8	 Antineoplastic, immunosuppressives and medicines used in palliative care
Notes: Can be produced by either Erwinia chrysanthemi or Escherichia coli. Children who are 

hypersensitive to asparaginase derived from one organism may tolerate asparaginase derived from 
another organism but cross-sensitivity occurs in 20–30% of individuals.

Asparaginase is a contact irritant. Care should be taken to avoid contact with skin or mucous 
membranes (especially eyes). If accidental contact occurs, the affected area should be flushed with 
water for at least 15 minutes.

8.2      Cytotoxic medicines
Interactions with other medicines (* indicates severe):
*	 Cisplatin: increased pulmonary toxicity.
*	 Oxygen: serious pulmonary toxicity in patients exposed to conventional oxygen concentrations 

during anaesthesia.
	 Phenytoin: possibly reduced absorption of phenytoin.
	 Vaccines, live: avoid use of live vaccines with bleomycin (impairment of immune response).
*	 Vinblastine: increased risk of cardiovascular toxicity.
	 Digoxin: bleomycin may decrease digoxin absorption.
	 Amphotericin B: concurrent bleomycin may increase nephrotoxicity and risk of hypotension and 

bronchospasm.
Notes: No single monitoring test reliably predicts bleomycin pulmonary toxicity, monitoring may 

include:
chest X-ray at baseline, then each week during and for 4 weeks after treatment;
pulmonary function tests (particularly total lung volume and forced vital capacity);
baseline and monthly evaluation of carbon monoxide diffusion capacity; stop treatment if it falls to 

< 30–35% of pretreatment value.
1500 international units of bleomycin are equivalent to 1.5 USP bleomycin units and approximately 

1.5 mg (by potency) or 1 mg (by weight). Caution is required when converting from mg to 
international units as protocols or trials may state bleomycin doses in terms of mg-potency rather 
than mg-weight.

Irritant to tissues; needs to be administered with care.

Carboplatin
ATC code: L01XA02

Injection: 10 mg/ml solution 5 ml, 15 ml, 45 ml and 60 ml vials

Handle as a cytotoxic agent.

Special Notes: This medicine is listed as a representative of its pharmacological class. Other 
medicines in the same class may have similar clinical performance and may be selected for local 
formularies based on availability and price. The information in this monograph only applies to the 
medicine listed here.

Indications: Stage 4 neuroblastoma; germ cell tumours; low-grade gliomas (including astrocytomas); 
neuroectodermal tumours (including medulloblastoma); rhabdomyosarcoma (metastatic and non-
metastatic disease); soft tissue sarcomas; retinoblastoma; high-risk Wilms tumour; some liver tumours.

Contraindications: Hypersensitivity to carboplatin, cisplatin, other platinum containing compounds 
or mannitol; severe bone marrow suppression or excessive bleeding; pregnancy; breastfeeding.

Precautions: Renal impairment.

Dose:
See specialist treatment protocols. 

Doses frequently calculated according to individual patient’s renal function and ability to clear 
the drug. 
Calvert formula for carboplatin dosing in adults: 
Total dose (mg) = target AUC (mg.minute/ml) x [GFR (ml/minute) + 25]. 
Modified Calvert formula for children: 
Total dose (mg) = [target AUC (mg.minute/ml)] x [GFR (ml/minute) + (0.36 x body weight in 
kilograms)].

Renal impairment: Renal function is often factored into dose calculations for carboplatin. If renally-
adjusted doses are not being used and the patient is renally impaired, consider reducing dose and 
monitor haematological parameters and renal function; avoid if creatinine clearance less than 
20 ml/minute.

Hepatic impairment: Dosage reduction not necessary.
Adverse effects: Common Myelosuppression (see below), nausea, vomiting, peripheral neuropathy, 

taste abnormality, fatigue, hypersensitivity reactions including anaphylaxis (risk increases with 
repeated exposure), reversible elevation of serum creatinine, mild and reversible electrolyte 
abnormalities (hyponatraemia, hypokalaemia, hypocalcaemia, hypomagnesaemia), mild elevations 
of ALP, liver transaminases and bilirubin, alopecia, myalgia, weakness.

Uncommon Ototoxicity, abdominal pain, diarrhoea, constipation, oral mucositis.
Rare Acute renal failure, haemolytic uraemic syndrome, loss of vision (at higher than usually 

recommended doses).
Myelosuppression Major dose-limiting effect. Thrombocytopenia is more common and pronounced than 
leukopenia; it may be cumulative and sometimes requires platelet transfusion. Nadir of platelet and neutrophil 
counts occurs 14–28 days after a dose, with recovery usually within 28 days. Anaemia may be cumulative and 
require transfusion.
Interactions with other medicines (* indicates severe):
	 Aminoglycosides: increased ototoxicity and nephrotoxicity.
	 Nephrotoxic drugs: increased renal toxicity.
	 Phenytoin: decreased serum levels of phenytoin.
	 Digoxin: reduced absorption of digoxin.
	 Clozapine: increased risk of agranulocytosis.
Notes: Needle or intravenous administration sets containing aluminium parts should not be used in 

the administration or preparation of carboplatin as an interaction may cause precipitate formation 
and loss of potency.

8.2      Cytotoxic medicines
Rare Heart failure (acute onset days after high-dose treatment; more common in older adult patients 

and those previously exposed to anthracyclines, may be reversible), pulmonary fibrosis (with long-
term treatment), hepatic veno-occlusive disease (high dose), water retention resembling syndrome 
of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH) resulting in hyponatraemia and seizures 
(more common in high doses).

Haemorrhagic cystitis Occurs as a result of accumulation of active metabolites in the bladder. 
Symptoms range from mild irritation on voiding to life-threatening haemorrhagic cystitis. Patients should be 
advised to drink plenty of fluids during therapy, void frequently, and avoid taking the drug at night. Intravenous 
hydration may be required. Mesna (not included on the 2nd WHO Model list of essential medicines for children) 
may be used. Toxicity is caused by the metabolite acrolein; mesna reacts specifically with acrolein in the urinary 
tract, preventing toxicity; mesna is given for the same duration as cyclophosphamide. It is generally given 
intravenously; the dose of mesna is equal to or greater than that of cyclophosphamide, often 125%.
Interactions with other medicines (* indicates severe):
*	 Allopurinol: increases the myelotoxicity of cyclophosphamide.
	 Carbamazepine: may increase conversion of cyclophosphamide to active metabolites.
*	 Chloramphenicol: reduced cyclophosphamide effectiveness.
*	 Ciclosporin: decreased ciclosporin concentration.
*	 Hydrochlorothiazide: increased myelotoxicity of cyclophosphamide.
*	 Ondansetron: reduced cyclophosphamide effectiveness.
	 Phenytoin: possibly reduced absorption of phenytoin.
	 Phenobarbital: may increase conversion of cyclophosphamide to active metabolites.
	 Suxamethonium: enhanced effect of suxamethonium.
	 Vaccines, live: avoid use of live vaccines with cyclophosphamide (impairment of immune 

response).
*	 Warfarin: increased INR and increased risk of bleeding.

See specialist treatment protocols.

WHO Model Formulary for Children 2010	 259



8	 Antineoplastic, immunosuppressives and medicines used in palliative care
Renal impairment: For low-dose regimens dose reductions are not necessary.
For high-dose therapy the following information should be considered:
elevated baseline serum creatinine (> 106 micromol/l ) is an independent risk factor for the 

development of neurotoxicity during treatment;
retrospective analysis implicates impaired renal function as an independent risk factor for high-dose 

cytarabine-induced cerebral and cerebellar toxicity;
the incidence of neurotoxicity is increased following administration of high-dose cytarabine to 

patients with even mildly impaired renal function.
Suggested dose reductions for high-dose therapy in patients with renal impairment.
Mild: 50–60% of normal dose.
Moderate or severe: avoid use of cytarabine high-dose.
Hepatic impairment: Reduce dose.
Adverse effects: Common Myelosuppression (see below), nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, oral mucositis, 

rash, fever, elevated liver function tests, alopecia, ocular discomfort.
Uncommon Conjunctivitis, gastrointestinal haemorrhage, oesophagitis, jaundice, dizziness, cellulitis 

at injection site, chest pain, urinary retention, renal impairment, anaphylaxis.
Rare Palmar-plantar erythrodysaesthesia, severe spinal cord toxicity following intrathecal 

administration.
Myelosuppression Major dose-limiting adverse effect, includes neutropenia, thrombocytopenia and 
anaemia, more severe after high doses or continuous infusions. Neutropenia is biphasic with a nadir 7–9 days after 
the dose and a more severe nadir at 15–24 days. Platelet nadir is 12–15 days after dose. Recovery generally occurs 
after a further 10 days.
High-dose therapy Associated with severe and sometimes fatal gastrointestinal, neurological and 
pulmonary toxicity; adverse effects include peripheral neuropathy, cerebral and cerebellar dysfunction, 
cardiomyopathy, pulmonary oedema, gastrointestinal ulceration. Reversible corneal toxicity leading to 
haemorrhagic conjunctivitis or keratitis can occur (prophylactic corticosteroid or lubricant eye drops may help).
Interactions with other medicines (* indicates severe):
	 Digoxin: decreases digoxin oral tablet absorption.
	 Flucytosine: plasma flucytosine concentration possibly reduced.
	 Phenytoin: reduced absorption of phenytoin.
	 Vaccines, live: avoid use of live vaccines with cytarabine (impairment of immune response).
Notes: Based on weight or body surface area, children may tolerate higher doses of cytarabine than 

adults.
Conjunctivitis (which occurs more frequently in high-dose therapy) is preventable and treatable with 

a corticosteroid eye drop. As prophylaxis, eye drops should be started 6–12 hours before initiation 
of cytarabine and continued for 24 hours following the last dose.

8.2      Cytotoxic medicines
Renal impairment: Accumulates; nephrotoxic.
Mild: 50–100% of normal dose.
Moderate: 50% of normal dose.
Severe: contraindicated.
Or refer to instructions in specialist protocols.
Hepatic impairment: Dose-related toxicity: avoid in severe hepatic impairment.
Adverse effects: Common Myelosuppression (see below), nausea and vomiting (more frequent 

with high doses), oral mucositis, pulmonary toxicity (see below), hepatotoxicity (see below), 
rash, itch, urticaria, photosensitivity, neurotoxicity (e.g. aseptic meningitis, encephalopathy, 
leukoencephalopathy) with high-dose or intrathecal use.

Uncommon Malaise, fatigue, chills, fever, headache, dizziness, tinnitus, blurred vision, alopecia, 
ocular irritation, oligospermia (transient).

Rare Anaphylactic/anaphylactoid reactions, severe skin reactions (e.g. Stevens-Johnson syndrome, 
toxic epidermal necrolysis), nephrotoxicity including renal failure, osteoporosis, skin and bone 
necrosis, macrocytic anaemia.

Myelosuppression Includes neutropenia, thrombocytopenia and anaemia. Neutrophil and platelet nadirs 
occur about 5–13 days after a bolus dose with recovery between 14 and 28 days. Neutropenia may sometimes be 
biphasic with the first nadir 4–7 days after a dose and the second at 12–21 days. Pancytopenia may occur and is 
potentially fatal.
Hepatotoxicity Increased aminotransferases are common and usually transient and asymptomatic. 
Chronic hepatotoxicity (including necrosis, fatty change, periportal fibrosis or cirrhosis) generally occurs with 
long-term therapy and is also dependent on cumulative dose.
Pulmonary toxicity Can develop rapidly and may be fatal. Often occurs as fever, dyspnoea, chest pain 
and dry, non-productive cough. Lesions such as pneumonitis and pulmonary fibrosis can occur at all doses at any 
time during treatment. Pulmonary toxicity may not be fully reversible; corticosteroids may relieve symptoms. 
Also consider the possibility of infection.
Interactions with other medicines (* indicates severe):
*	 Acetylsalicylic acid: reduced excretion of methotrexate (increased toxicity).
	 Amoxicillin: reduced excretion of methotrexate (increased risk of toxicity).
	 Ampicillin: reduced excretion of methotrexate (increased risk of toxicity).
	 Benzylpenicillin: reduced excretion of methotrexate (increased risk of toxicity).

	 Silver sulfadiazine: increased risk of methotrexate toxicity.
	 Sulfadiazine: risk of methotrexate toxicity increased.
*	 Sulfadoxine + pyrimethamine: antifolate effect of methotrexate increased; risk of methotrexate 

toxicity increased.

WHO Model Formulary for Children 2010	 269



8	 Antineoplastic, immunosuppressives and medicines used in palliative care
*	 Sulfamethoxazole + trimethoprim: antifolate effect of methotrexate increased (avoid concomitant 

use); risk of methotrexate toxicity increased.
*	 Trimethoprim: antifolate effect of methotrexate increased (avoid concomitant use).
	 Vaccines, live: avoid use of live vaccines with methotrexate (impairment of immune response).
*	 Warfarin: increased risk for elevated INR and subsequent bleeding.
Notes: High-dose methotrexate may cause precipitation of methotrexate or its metabolites in renal 

tubules. A high fluid throughput and alkalinization of urine, using sodium hydrogen carbonate if 
necessary, is recommended.

Patients or their carers should be advised to report any feature of blood disorders (e.g. sore throat, 
bruising and mouth ulcers), liver toxicity (e.g. nausea, vomiting, abdominal discomfort and dark 
urine) and respiratory toxicity (e.g. dry cough, shortness of breath).

8.3      Hormones and antihormones
The corticosteroids prednisolone, dexamethasone and hydrocortisone are synthetic hormones 
which may be given at pharmacological doses for certain malignancies, particularly haematological 
malignancies. However, chronic use of steroids is associated with a range of side-effects which are 
covered in more detail in section 18.1.

Dexamethasone
ATC code: H02AB02

Oral liquid: 0.4 mg/ml
Injection: 4 mg dexamethasone phosphate (as disodium salt) in 1 ml ampoule

Immunosuppression may occur, patients may be more susceptible to infections, avoid exposure 
to chickenpox and measles. Corticosteroids may activate latent opportunistic infections or 
exacerbate systemic fungal infections. Acute myopathy may occur with high doses, elevated 
intraocular pressure may occur (especially with prolonged use), CNS effects ranging from 
euphoria to psychosis may occur.

Indications: Used with antineoplastic drugs for acute lymphoblastic leukaemias, Hodgkin disease 
and non-Hodgkin lymphomas; for inflammatory or allergic reactions including those to other 
antineoplastic drugs; pre- and post-chemotherapy as an antiemetic (see Section 17.2).

Contraindications: Untreated systemic infection (unless condition life threatening); administration 
of live virus vaccines.

Precautions: Abrupt withdrawal (see below); increased susceptibility to and severity of infection; 
activation or exacerbation of tuberculosis, amoebiasis, strongyloidiasis; risk of severe chickenpox in 
non-immune patient (varicella zoster immunoglobulin required if exposed to chickenpox); avoid 
exposure to measles (normal immunoglobulin possibly required if exposed); diabetes mellitus; 
peptic ulcer; hypertension.

Abrupt withdrawal Dexamethasone may cause suppression of hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) 
axis, especially in younger children or those on high doses for prolonged periods. Withdrawal and discontinuation 
of dexamethasone should be done slowly and carefully. Consult local protocols.

Dose:
See specialist treatment protocols.

Renal impairment: Dose reduction not necessary.
Hepatic impairment: Metabolized by the liver but also by other tissues; dose reduction not necessary.
Adverse effects: Incidence of adverse effects is related to dose and duration of treatment. Short high-

dose courses cause fewer adverse effects than prolonged courses of lower doses.
Common Adrenal suppression, increased susceptibility to infection, masking of signs of infection, 

sodium and water retention, oedema, hypertension, hypokalaemia, hyperglycaemia, dyslipidaemia, 
osteoporosis, fractures, increased appetite, dyspepsia, delayed wound healing, skin atrophy,

ATC code: H02AB09

Powder for injection: 100 mg (as sodium succinate) in vial

Hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) suppression may occur, acute adrenal insufficiency 
(adrenal crisis) may occur with abrupt withdrawal after long-term therapy or with stress; 
withdrawal and discontinuation of steroids should be done carefully; patients with HPA axis 
suppression may require doses of systemic glucocorticosteroids prior to, during and after 
unusual stress (e.g. surgery). Immunosuppression may occur; patients may be more susceptible 
to infections; avoid exposure to chicken pox and measles. Corticosteroids may activate latent 
opportunistic infections or exacerbate systemic fungal infections. May cause osteoporosis (at any 
age) or inhibition of bone growth in paediatric patients. Acute myopathy may occur with high 
doses, elevated intraocular pressure may occur (especially with prolonged use), and CNS effects 
(ranging from euphoria to psychosis) may occur.

Indications: Synthetic hormone used as an adjuvant in treatment of malignancy.
Contraindications: Untreated systemic infection (unless condition life threatening); administration 

of live virus vaccines.
Precautions: Avoid using higher than recommended doses; suppression of HPA function, 

suppression of linear growth (i.e. reduction of growth velocity), reduced bone mineral density, 
hypercorticism (Cushing syndrome), hyperglycaemia or glycosuria may occur; titrate to lowest 
effective dose. Use with extreme caution in patients with respiratory tuberculosis or ocular herpes 
simplex; use with caution in patients with thyroid dysfunction, cirrhosis, nonspecific ulcerative 
colitis, hypertension, glaucoma, myasthenia gravis, diabetes.

Dose:
See specialist treatment protocols.

hypercorticism (Cushing syndrome), hyperglycaemia or glycosuria may occur, titrate to lowest 
effective dose. Use with extreme caution in patients with respiratory tuberculosis or ocular herpes 
simplex; use with caution in patients with thyroid dysfunction, cirrhosis, non-specific ulcerative 
colitis, hypertension, glaucoma, myasthenia gravis, diabetes.

Dose:
Oral:  

Child less than 1 year initially up to 25 mg, then 5–10 mg daily;  
2–7 years initially up to 50 mg, then 10–20 mg daily;  
8–12 years initially up to 75 mg, then 15–30 mg daily.  
The above doses are only a guide and should only be used as part of a treatment protocol which 
includes other antineoplastic drugs and under specialist advice.

Renal impairment: Dose reduction not needed.
Hepatic impairment: Adverse effects more common.
Adverse effects: Incidence of adverse effects is related to dose and duration of treatment. Short high-

dose courses cause fewer adverse effects than prolonged courses of lower doses.
Common Adrenal suppression, increased susceptibility to infection, masking of signs of infection, 

sodium and water retention, oedema, hypertension, hypokalaemia, hyperglycaemia, dyslipidaemia, 
osteoporosis, fractures, increased appetite, dyspepsia, delayed wound healing, skin atrophy, 
bruising, acne, hirsutism, growth retardation in children, myopathy, muscle weakness and wasting, 
fat redistribution (producing cushingoid appearance), weight gain, amenorrhoea, psychiatric 
effects (see below).

Uncommon Osteonecrosis, particularly of the femoral and humeral heads.
Rare Peptic ulceration, posterior subcapsular cataracts, glaucoma, hypersensitivity reactions.
Psychiatric effects Include euphoria, hypomania, depression, disturbances of mood, cognition, sleep 
and behaviour. Delirium or psychosis are less common.

8	 Antineoplastic, immunosuppressives and medicines used in palliative care

8.4      Medicines used in palliative care
Access to appropriate medicines is needed to ensure adequate management of the most prevalent and 
distressing symptoms in children with life-threatening and life-limiting conditions.
Globally, malignancy and HIV/AIDS have been identified as the most common causes of childhood 
mortality requiring palliative care. Based on available data, the 10 most frequent symptoms or symptom 
clusters requiring pharmacological management for palliative care include fatigue and weakness, pain, 
anorexia and weight loss, delirium and agitation, breathlessness, nausea and vomiting, constipation, 
depression, excess respiratory tract secretions and anxiety.
A range of medications may be used to treat these symptom clusters. Systematic evidence for the 
safety and efficacy of these medicines in paediatric populations is often lacking. In the absence of 
randomized controlled trials in paediatric populations, recommendations have been based on current 
best available evidence which may be extrapolated from adult studies or, in some instances, based on 
expert opinion.

Tablet: 50 mg

Indications: Nausea and vomiting in palliative care including after radiotherapy or chemotherapy.
Precautions: May counteract haemodynamic effects of opioids; porphyria; glaucoma; obstructive 

disease of the gastrointestinal tract; hepatic disease; epilepsy; severe heart failure (cyclizine may 
cause a fall in cardiac output associated with increases in heart rate, mean arterial pressure and 
pulmonary wedge pressure).

Patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose intolerance, the Lapp lactase deficiency or 
glucose-galactose malabsorption should not take this medicine.

Dose:
Oral or IV injection:  

Infant or Child 1 month–6 years 0.5–1 mg/kg up to three times daily, maximum single dose 
25 mg;  
6–12 years 25 mg up to three times daily. 
Continuous intravenous or subcutaneous infusion:  
Child 1 month–2 years 3 mg/kg over 24 hours;  
2–5 years 50 mg over 24 hours;  
6–12 years 75 mg over 24 hours.

Renal impairment: Dose reduction not necessary.
Hepatic impairment: Causes sedation in liver impairment (avoid).
Adverse effects: Common Urticaria, rash, drowsiness, headache, dryness of the mouth, nose and 

throat, blurred vision, tachycardia, urinary retention, constipation, restlessness, nervousness, 
insomnia and auditory and visual hallucinations have been reported, particularly when dosage 
recommendations have been exceeded.

Rare Cholestatic jaundice has occurred in association with cyclizine. Rare reports of cholestatic 
hepatitis and hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis, angioedema, allergic skin reactions 
and bronchospasm, have been reported in association with cyclizine. Other central nervous system 
effects include dystonia, dyskinesia, extrapyramidal motor disturbances, tremor, twitching, muscle 
spasms, seizures, disorientation, dizziness, decreased consciousness, transient speech disorders, 
hypertension and paraesthesia. There have also been a few reports of fixed drug eruption, apnoea, 
generalized chorea, hypersensitivity hepatitis, hepatic dysfunction and agranulocytosis.

Interactions with other medicines (* indicates severe):
	 Alcohol: cyclizine may have additive effects with alcohol and other central nervous system 

depressants, e.g. hypnotics, tranquillizers, anaesthetics.
	 Pethidine: cyclizine enhances the soporific effect of pethidine.
	 Anticholinergic drugs: because of its anticholinergic activity, cyclizine may enhance the side-

effects of other anticholinergic drugs.

282	 WHO Model Formulary for Children 2010



8.4      Medicines used in palliative care
Notes: For administration by mouth, tablets may be crushed.
There have been reports of abuse of cyclizine, either oral or intravenous, for its euphoric or 

hallucinatory effects. The concomitant misuse of cyclizine with large amounts of alcohol is 
particularly dangerous, since the antiemetic effect of cyclizine may increase the toxicity of alcohol.

Direct intravenous injection may be given over 3–5 minutes.

10.1    Antianaemia medicines

10	 Medicines affecting the blood

10.1    Antianaemia medicines
Anaemia occurs when the blood haemoglobin concentration falls below the reference range for the 
age and gender of the individual. Anaemia is a major global public health problem with major 
consequences for child health and development. The most significant contributor to the onset of 
anaemia is iron deficiency. The main risk factors for iron deficiency anaemia (IDA) in children 
include inadequate intake of iron-containing food, especially during periods of rapid growth when 
iron requirements are high, and parasitic infections (e.g. hookworm). Other contributing factors 
include malaria, micronutrient deficiencies (e.g. folate), haemoglobinopathies (e.g. sickle cell anemia 
or thalassemia), and anaemia of chronic disorders such as HIV infection or tuberculosis.
For detailed clinical guidelines regarding management of anaemia in children see the WHO Pocket 
Book of Hospital Care for Children, found at (http://www.who.int/child_adolescent_health/docu-
ments/9241546700/en/index.html).
For further details on prevention of anaemia see Guidelines for the Use of Iron Supplements to Prevent 
and Treat Iron Deficiency Anaemia, found at http://www.who.int/nutrition/publications/micronutri-
ents/anaemia_iron_deficiency/1-57881-020-5/en/index.html.

Ferrous salt
ATC code: B03AA; B03AB

Oral liquid: equivalent to 25 mg of elemental iron (as sulfate)/ml
Tablet: equivalent to 60 mg of elemental iron

Iron preparations are an important cause of accidental overdose in children and as little as 
20 mg/kg of elemental iron can lead to symptoms of toxicity. Adequate precautions including 
the use of child-resistant containers should be taken to store iron preparations to prevent such 
overdoses.

Indications: Used for iron deficiency anaemia or as nutritional supplement.
Contraindications: Haemosiderosis; haemochromatosis; any form of anaemia not caused by iron 

deficiency; patients receiving repeated blood transfusions; parenteral iron therapy.
Precautions: Should not be administered for longer than 6 months; peptic ulcer; regional enteritis; 

ulcerative colitis; intestinal strictures; diverticula; overdosage (see section 4.2).

Dose:
Treatment of iron deficiency anaemia. 

Oral:  
Neonate 2–4 mg/kg of elemental iron daily, given in 2–3 divided doses. 
Infant and Child 3–6 mg/kg (maximum 200 mg) of elemental iron daily, given in 2–3 divided 
doses.

Prevention of iron deficiency anaemia (in those at particular risk). 
Oral:  
Child under 5 years 1–2 mg/kg (maximum 30 mg) of elemental iron daily;  
over 5 years 30–60 mg of elemental iron daily.

Renal impairment: Dose reduction not necessary.
Hepatic impairment: Dose reduction not necessary.

WHO Model Formulary for Children 2010	 297



10	 Medicines affecting the blood
Adverse effects: Common Constipation, diarrhoea, dark stools, nausea, epigastric pain, 

gastrointestinal irritation.
Uncommon Long-term or excessive administration may cause haemosiderosis.
Interactions with other medicines (* indicates severe):
	 Calcium salts: reduced absorption of oral ferrous salts.
	 Ciprofloxacin: absorption of ciprofloxacin reduced by oral ferrous salts.
*	 Dimercaprol: avoid concomitant use.
	 Doxycycline: absorption of oral ferrous salts reduced by doxycycline; absorption of doxycycline 

reduced by oral ferrous salts.
	 Levodopa: absorption of levodopa may be reduced by oral ferrous salts.
	 Levofloxacin: absorption of levofloxacin reduced by oral ferrous salts.
	 Levothyroxine: absorption of levothyroxine reduced by oral ferrous salts (give at least 2 hours 

apart).
	 Methyldopa: oral ferrous salts reduce hypotensive effect of methyldopa.
	 Ofloxacin: absorption of ofloxacin reduced by oral ferrous salts.
	 Penicillamine: oral ferrous salts reduce absorption of penicillamine.
	 Zinc sulfate: absorption of zinc and of oral ferrous salts reduced.
Notes: Iron content in artificial formula feeds should be taken into account when considering iron 

supplementation.
1 mg elemental iron = approximately 3 mg dried ferrous sulfate = approximately 9 mg ferrous 

gluconate.
Compliance may be increased by giving the total daily dose as a single daily dose. However, 

gastrointestinal side-effects are increased and split daily doses may be better tolerated.
Although iron preparations are best absorbed on an empty stomach, they may be taken after food to 

reduce gastrointestinal adverse effects. They may discolour stools.
Liquid preparations containing iron salts should be well diluted with water. If possible, swallow 

through a drinking straw and brush teeth after administration to prevent discoloration of the 
teeth.

Temporary discoloration of the teeth can be minimized by brushing the teeth with baking soda.
Increase fibre in diet to minimize constipation.

10.2    Medicines affecting coagulation
Anticoagulants are used to prevent thrombus (blood clot) formation, or extension of an existing 
thrombus, in the slower moving venous side of the circulation.
Thromboembolic disease is increasingly recognised in neonates and children. However, coagulation 
systems of children and adults are different, with important implications for use of anticoagulant 
medications in children. Anticoagulation in children should only be undertaken with specialist 
supervision and careful monitoring. 

Phytomenadione
ATC code: B02BA01

Injection: 1 mg/1 ml, 10 mg/ml in 5 ml ampoule
Tablet 10 mg

Intravenous injections should be given very slowly (risk of vascular collapse).

Special Notes: Also referred to as vitamin K1, phytonadione.
Indications: Antagonist to warfarin; prophylaxis against haemorrhagic disease of the newborn.
Precautions: Hepatic impairment; not an antidote to heparin.

Dose:
Prophylaxis of haemorrhagic disease of the newborn. 

IM:  
Neonate 0.5–1 mg as single dose at birth. 
Oral:  
Neonate 2 mg followed by a second dose after 4–7 days and, for breastfed babies, a third dose 
after 1 month. 
IV:  
Pre-term neonate 400 micrograms/kg (maximum 1 mg). 

Note The IV route is preferred by some in pre-term neonates of very low birth weight, but it does not 
provide the prolonged protection of the IM injection; any babies receiving IV vitamin K should be given 
subsequent oral doses (as per oral dosing, above).

300	 WHO Model Formulary for Children 2010



10.2    Medicines affecting coagulation

Treatment of haemorrhagic disease of the newborn. 
IV:  
Neonate 1 mg with further doses if necessary every 8 hours.

Warfarin-induced hypoprothrombinaemia with no or minor bleeding. 
IV:  
Child 1 month–12 years 15–30 micrograms/kg (maximum 1 mg) as a single dose, repeated as 
necessary.

Warfarin-induced hypoprothrombinaemia: reversal of anticoagulation or if significant bleeding; 
treatment of haemorrhage associated with vitamin K deficiency. 
IV:  
Child 1 month–12 years 250–300 micrograms/kg (maximum 10 mg) as a single dose.

Renal impairment: Dose reduction not necessary.
Hepatic impairment: Higher doses may be required for adequate response.
Adverse effects: Uncommon Hypersensitivity reactions including flushing, dyspnoea, bronchospasm, 

dizziness, hypotension and respiratory or circulatory collapse which may be due to polyethoxylated 
castor oil surfactant in some injection formulations, rather than due to phytomenadione.

Interactions with other medicines (* indicates severe):
*	 Warfarin: vitamin K antagonizes anticoagulant effect of warfarin.
Notes: In infants with cholestatic disease, vitamin K must be given either intramuscularly or 

intravenously because oral absorption is likely to be impaired.
Intravenous preparations can usually be given orally. Please check specific product information.
Tablets may be chewed.

the APTT or of the anti-Factor Xa concentration. Local guidelines on recommended APTT for 
neonates and children should be followed.

If haemorrhage occurs, it is usually sufficient to withdraw heparin, but if rapid reversal of heparin 
effects is required, protamine sulfate is a specific antidote.

10.2    Medicines affecting coagulation

Protamine sulfate
ATC code: V03AB14

Injection: 10 mg/ml in 5 ml ampoule
Indications: Used to treat heparin overdose. If used in excess it has an anticoagulant effect.
Precautions: If used in excess, protamine has an anticoagulant effect; allergic reactions increased in 

persons at risk including previous treatment with protamine or protamine insulin; fish allergies; 
rapid administration or high dose. 

Dose:
Heparin overdose by IV injection or IV infusion. 

IV:  
Child 1 month–12 years 1 mg of protamine neutralizes approximately 100 units of heparin if 
less than 30 minutes has elapsed since overdose; 500–750 micrograms if 30–60 minutes has 
elapsed; 375–500 micrograms if 60–120 minutes has elapsed; 250–375 micrograms if over 
120 minutes has elapsed. Maximum dose 50 mg. Do not exceed a rate of 5 mg/minute.

Heparin overdose by SC injection. 
IV:  
Child 1 month–12 years 1 mg neutralizes approximately 100 units of heparin. Give 50–100% of 
the total dose by IV injection (rate not exceeding 5 mg/minute); then give any remainder of the 
dose by intravenous infusion over 8–16 hours. Maximum total dose 50 mg.

Renal impairment: Dose reduction not necessary.
Hepatic impairment: Dose reduction not necessary.
Adverse effects: Uncommon Nausea, vomiting, lassitude, flushing, hypotension/hypertension.
Rare Bradycardia, dyspnoea, allergic reactions (including angioedema, anaphylaxis), cardiovascular 

collapse, pulmonary vasoconstriction/hypertension.
Interactions with other medicines (* indicates severe):
There are no known interactions involving a significant change in effect or where it is recommended 

to avoid concomitant use.
Notes: 1 mg neutralizes approximately 100 units of unfractionated heparin when given within 

15 minutes; if longer time, less protamine is needed as heparin is rapidly excreted.
Monitor activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) or other appropriate blood clotting 

parameters.
Do not administer at a rate exceeding 5 mg/minute.
May be diluted if necessary with sodium chloride 0.9%.

10	 Medicines affecting the blood

Warfarin
ATC code: B01AA03

Tablet: 0.5 mg; 1 mg; 2 mg; 5 mg (sodium salt)

Serious and potentially fatal bleeding may occur, especially during initiation of treatment and 
with higher doses.

Special Notes: This medicine is listed as a representative of its pharmacological class. Other 
medicines in the same class may have similar clinical performance and may be selected for local 
formularies based on availability and price. The information in this monograph only applies to the 
medicine listed here.

Indications: Prophylaxis of embolization in rheumatic heart disease and atrial fibrillation; prophylaxis 
after insertion of prosthetic heart valve; prophylaxis and treatment of venous thrombosis and 
pulmonary embolism; transient ischaemic attacks.

Contraindications: Pregnancy; peptic ulcer; severe hypertension; bacterial endocarditis.
Precautions: Hepatic impairment or renal failure; recent surgery; avoid cranberry juice (risk of 

potentiating anticoagulant effect).

Dose:
Note Wherever possible, the baseline prothrombin time should be determined before the initial dose is 
given, but the initial dose should not be delayed while awaiting the result.
Induction dose may need to be altered according to condition (e.g. hepatic impairment, cardiac failure), 
concomitant interacting drugs, and if baseline INR is above 1.3.
Prophylaxis and treatment of thromboembolic disorders. 

Oral:  
Neonate (under specialist advice) 200 micrograms/kg as a single dose on day 1, then 
100 micrograms/kg once daily for following 3 days. 
However, if INR is still below 1.4, continue to use 200 micrograms/kg once daily. If the INR 
is above 3, change to 50 micrograms/kg once daily, and if INR is above 3.5, omit dose. Adjust 
ongoing therapy in accordance with INR. 
Usual maintenance 100–300 micrograms/kg once daily (may need up to 400 micrograms/kg 
once daily, especially if bottle fed; see Notes).

	 Valproic acid: anticoagulant effect possibly enhanced.
	 Cranberry juice and products: enhanced anticoagulant effect (cranberry flavonoids inhibit CYP2C9).
	 High doses of vitamin A, E or C: altered prothrombin time.
Notes: Monitoring It is essential that the INR be determined daily or on alternate days in the early days of 
treatment, and then at longer intervals (depending on response), then up to every 12 weeks.
Infant formula is supplemented with vitamin K, which makes formula fed infants resistant to 

warfarin; they may need higher doses. Breast milk contains low concentrations of vitamin K and 
breastfed infants are more sensitive to warfarin.

Avoid switching warfarin brands once desired therapeutic response has been achieved.
Target INR range: generally 2–3 for most indications; 2.5–3.5 for prosthetic heart valves and 

antiphospholipid antibody syndrome associated with thrombosis.
Other considerations Warfarin antagonizes the effects of vitamin K and takes at least 48–72 hours for 
the anticoagulant effect to develop fully; if an immediate effect is required, heparin must be given concomitantly.
Foods containing high amounts of vitamin K (such as beef liver, pork liver, green tea and green leafy vegetables) 
can reverse the anticoagulant effects of warfarin and affect therapeutic outcomes. A balanced diet is essential. 
Avoid large amounts of alfalfa, asparagus, broccoli, brussel sprouts, cabbage, cauliflower, green teas, kale, lettuce, 
spinach, turnip greens, watercress.
High doses of vitamin A, E or C may alter prothrombin time, use fish oils or omega 3 with caution and avoid 
large amounts of liver, avocado, soy protein, soybean, papain.
Avoid herbal teas or remedies (e.g. tonka beans, melilot, woodruff) as these contain natural coumarins and may 
increase the effect of warfarin.

There are currently no medicines in this section of the 2nd WHO Model List of Essential Medicines for 
Children.

11.2    Plasma fractions for specific use
Blood coagulation factors
Factor VIII is essential for blood clotting and the maintenance of effective haemostasis. Von Willebrand 
factor is a mediator in platelet aggregation and also acts as a carrier for factor VIII. Blood coagulation 
factors VII, IX and X are essential for the conversion of factor II (prothrombin) to thrombin clot.
Deficiency in any of these factors results in haemophilia, a group of X-linked bleeding disorders  
affecting 1 in 7000 males, most commonly presenting as bleeding into joints. Haemophilia A is 
factor VIII deficiency and haemophilia B is factor IX deficiency. Bleeding episodes in haemophilia 
require prompt treatment with replacement therapy.

Human normal immunoglobulin
Normal immunoglobulin solution is used as a source of antibody replacement in primary immuno-
deficiencies, and to modify the immune response in conditions such as Kawasaki disease.

Factor VIII concentrate
ATC code: B02BD02

Dried
Special Notes: Also known as antihaemophilic factor or Von Willebrand factor complex.
This medicine is listed as a representative of its pharmacological class. Other medicines in the same 

class may have similar clinical performance and may be selected for local formularies based on 
availability and price. The information in this monograph only applies to the medicine listed here.

Indications: Control of haemorrhage in haemophilia A.
Contraindications: Previous anaphylactic reaction to factor VIII concentrate.
Precautions: Intravascular haemolysis after large or frequently repeated doses in patients with blood 

groups A, B or AB (less likely with high potency, highly purified concentrates).

Dose:
Haemophilia A.  

Slow IV infusion:  
Administer according to patient’s needs and specific preparation used. For every 1 international 
unit per kg body weight of factor VIII activity administered, factor VIII level should increase by 
2 international units/ml (or 2%); calculated dosage should be adjusted to the actual vial size.  
Calculation for units required, based on desired increase in factor VIII (% of normal).  
International units required = body weight (kg) x 0.5 x desired increase in factor VIII 
(international units/ml or % of normal). 

Note This calculation assumes the patient’s baseline factor VIII level is < 1%.
Renal impairment: Dose adjustment not required.

Human normal immunoglobulin
ATC code: J06BA02

Intramuscular administration: 16% protein solution*
Intravenous administration: 5%; 10% protein solution**
Subcutaneous administration: 15%; 16% protein solution*

Intravenous human normal immunoglobulin may very rarely induce thromboembolic events 
and should be used with caution in those with risk factors for arterial or venous thrombotic 
events and in obese individuals.
Normal immunoglobulin may interfere with the immune response to live virus vaccines which 
should therefore only be given at least 3 weeks before or 3 months after an injection of normal 
immunoglobulin (this does not apply to yellow fever vaccine since normal immunoglobulin 
does not contain antibody to this virus).

Children.

12.3    Antihypertensive medicines
Hypertension
Blood pressure (BP) in children is classified according to centile charts according to age, gender and 
height. Hypertension in children is therefore defined as either systolic and/or diastolic BP ≥ 95th 
percentile measured on three or more separate occasions.
The goals of initial management of children with hypertension are to:
•	 establish whether it is secondary to an underlying cause which can be treated
•	 manage hypertensive emergencies
•	 determine if medication is required for blood pressure control
•	 assess and manage any associated cardiovascular risk factors (e.g. diabetes or obesity).
Specialist assessment and advice should be sought when possible.

Management
Hypertension which is severe (e.g. 5 mmHg greater than the 99th percentile) or symptomatic 
requires urgent pharmacological management. Symptoms suggestive of a hypertensive emergency 
include headache, seizures, altered conscious state, focal neurological symptoms or signs, visual 
disturbance or clinical features suggestive of cardiac failure (e.g. respiratory distress, chest pain). 
Controlled reduction in blood pressure should occur over a period of 72–96 hours, since rapid reduction 
can cause “end organ damage”. Controlled reduction should therefore be undertaken in hospital with 
careful supervision and monitoring.
In hypertension which is mild to moderate and is not symptomatic, nonpharmacological measures 
(e.g. dietary measures such as salt restriction, management of obesity) should be considered. 
Pharmacological management may also be required, depending on duration of hypertension, any 
evidence of associated end organ damage (e.g. left ventricular hypertrophy or retinopathy), and 
associated conditions including other cardiovascular risk factors (e.g. diabetes mellitus).

Enalapril
ATC code: C09AA02

Tablet: 2.5 mg; 5 mg
Special Notes: This medicine is listed as a representative of its pharmacological class. Other 

medicines in the same class may have similar clinical performance and may be selected for local 
formularies based on availability and price. The information in this monograph only applies to the 
medicine listed here.

Indications: Hypertension; heart failure.
Contraindications: Hypersensitivity to angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors (including 

angioedema); renovascular disease; pregnancy.
Precautions: Use with diuretics; hypotension with first doses, especially in patients on diuretics, 

on a low-sodium diet, on dialysis, if dehydrated, or with heart failure; peripheral vascular disease 
or generalized atherosclerosis (risk of clinically silent renovascular disease); use with great care in 
severe or symptomatic aortic stenosis; monitor renal function before and during treatment; renal 
impairment; hepatic impairment; possibly increased risk of agranulocytosis in collagen vascular 
disease; history of idiopathic or hereditary angioedema (use with care or avoid).

Use with diuretics Risk of very rapid falls in blood pressure in volume-depleted patients; treatment 
should therefore be initiated with very low doses. High-dose diuretic therapy should be discontinued, or dose 
significantly reduced, at least 24 hours before starting enalapril (may not be possible in heart failure; risk of 
pulmonary oedema). If high-dose diuretic cannot be stopped, medical supervision advised for at least 2 hours 
after administration or until blood pressure is stable.
Anaphylactoid reactions Avoid enalapril during dialysis with high-flux polyacrilonitrile membranes 
and during low-density lipoprotein apheresis with dextran sulfate; also withhold before desensitization with wasp 
or bee venom.

Dose:
Hypertension and heart failure. 

Oral: 
Neonate initially 10 micrograms/kg once daily, increased as necessary up to 500 micrograms/kg  
daily in 1–3 divided doses. Monitor blood pressure and urine output carefully for at least 
2 hours following first dose and during dose escalation until blood pressure is stable. 
Infant or Child initially 100 micrograms/kg once daily. Monitor blood pressure carefully for 
1–2 hours, increased as necessary up to a maximum of 1 mg/kg daily in 1–2 divided doses.

Renal impairment: Use with caution in all degrees of impairment and monitor response. Start with a 
lower initial dose and adjust according to response. Hyperkalaemia and other adverse effects more 
common.

Hepatic impairment: Closely monitor liver function in patients with hepatic impairment.
Adverse effects: Common Hypotension, cough, hyperkalaemia, headache, dizziness, fatigue, nausea, 

renal impairment.

The neonatal response to treatment with ACE inhibitors is very variable, and some neonates 

develop profound hypotension with even small doses; a test dose should be used initially and 
increased cautiously. Adverse effects such as apnoea, seizures, renal failure and severe unpredictable 
hypotension are very common in the first month of life and it is therefore recommended that ACE 
inhibitors are avoided whenever possible, particularly in preterm neonates.

septal defects), valvular disease (e.g. in rheumatic heart disease), myocardial dysfunction or high-
output heart failure (e.g. anaemia). Rheumatic heart disease remains a very large cause of heart failure 
in the developing world.

12	 Cardiovascular medicines
Notes: Monitoring For plasma digoxin concentration assay, blood should ideally be taken at least 6 hours 
after a dose, preferably prior to next dose, plasma digoxin concentration should be maintained in the range 
0.8–2 micrograms/litre.
Unwanted effects depend both on the concentration of digoxin in the plasma and on sensitivity of the conducting 
system or of the myocardium, which is often increased in heart disease. It can sometimes be difficult to distinguish 
between toxic effects and clinical deterioration because the symptoms of both are similar. Also, the plasma digoxin 
concentration alone cannot indicate toxicity reliably but the likelihood of toxicity increases progressively through the 
range 1.5–3 micrograms/litre for digoxin. Renal function is very important in determining digoxin dosage.
Signs of digoxin toxicity may include: anorexia, nausea, vomiting, dizziness, bradycardia and heart block. Patients 
at highest risk are those with renal impairment.
Administration For intravenous infusion, dilute with sodium chloride 0.9% or glucose 5% to a maximum 
concentration of 62.5 micrograms/ml; loading doses should be given over 30–60 minutes and maintenance doses 
over 10–20 minutes. Protect from light.
For oral administration, oral solution must not be diluted.
Doses may need to be reduced if digoxin (or another cardiac glycoside) has been given in the 

preceding 2 weeks. When changing from intravenous to oral route, may need to increase dose by 
20–30% to maintain the same plasma digoxin concentration.

Plasma monitoring may be required when changing formulation to take into account varying 
bioavailabilities.

13	 Dermatological medicines (topical)

13.1    Antifungal medicines
“Tinea” refers to a skin or nail infection with a dermatophyte (ringworm) fungus. Other fungi, 
such as Candida, can cause local skin infections as well as more serious systemic infections. Local 
treatments are often effective, and the choice of agent is often dictated by local availability and price. 
More severe infections may require systemic treatments. 

Benzoic acid + Salicylic acid
ATC code: D01AE20

Cream or ointment: 6% + 3%
Special Notes: Also known as Whitfield’s ointment.
Indications: Mild fungal skin infections, particularly localized tinea pedis and tinea corporis.
Precautions: Contact with eyes, mucous membranes, face and genitals; prolonged use; large areas. 

Administration:
Fungal skin infections.  

Topical:  
Infant or Child apply twice daily until the infected skin is shed (usually at least 4 weeks).

Renal impairment: Dose reduction not required.
Hepatic impairment: Dose reduction not required.
Adverse effects: Uncommon Occasionally localized, mild inflammatory reaction.
Rare Skin ulceration, erosion, salicylate intoxication, systemic absorption.
Salicylate intoxication Although rare, topical use of salicylic acid has resulted in salicylate intoxication, 
particularly in babies and young children when applied in large amounts or when used under occlusion. 
Symptoms include confusion, dizziness, headaches, rapid breathing, tinnitus; deaths have occurred.
Interactions with other medicines (* indicates severe):
	  Warfarin: topical salicylates may be absorbed in sufficient amounts to cause an increase in INR, 

increasing risk of bleeding; avoid combinations.
Notes: Benzoic acid + salicylic acid are both mild irritants and can themselves cause dermatitis.

13	 Dermatological medicines (topical)

Silver sulfadiazine
ATC code: D06BA01

Cream: 1%

Use with caution if allergic to sulfonamides or the preservative agent used, e.g. chlorhexidine.
Owing to the association of sulfonamides with severe blood and skin disorders, treatment 
should be stopped immediately if blood disorders or rashes develop. Leukopenia developing 
2–3 days after starting treatment of burns patients is reported usually to be self limiting and 
silver sulfadiazine need not usually be discontinued, provided blood counts are monitored 
carefully to ensure return to baseline within a few days. Argyria may also occur if large areas of 
skin are treated (or if application is prolonged).

Special Notes: WHO age/weight restriction: > 2 months.
Indications: Prophylaxis and treatment of infection in burns.
Contraindications: Hypersensitivity to sulfonamides; pregnancy; < 2 months age.
Precautions: Renal or hepatic impairment; large areas; G6PD deficiency.

Administration:
Prophylaxis and treatment of infection in burns.  

Topical:  
Child over 2 months apply using aseptic technique daily (more frequent if volume of exudate is 
large) while there is a possibility of infection, or until healing is complete.

Renal impairment: Use with caution in patients with impaired renal function, particularly those 
receiving treatment for extensive burns.

Hepatic impairment: Severe: use with caution.
Adverse effects: Common Pain, rash, burning, itching.
Rare Necrosis of skin, erythema multiforme, skin discoloration due to deposition of silver, transient 

neutropenia, transient leukopenia, development of bacterial resistance, hypersensitivity reactions, 
argyria and sulfonamide induced systemic toxicity.

Interactions with other medicines (* indicates severe):
When used over large areas of skin, plasma sulfadiazine concentrations may approach therapeutic 

levels and when this occurs the interactions below apply.
Sulfadiazine can cause nephrotoxicity; administration with other nephrotoxic drugs may result in 

additional renal adverse effects.
Sulfadiazine is a folate antagonist and will add to the effects on bone marrow of other folate 

antagonists, e.g. pyrimethamine.
	 Ciclosporin: sulfadiazine may decrease ciclosporin concentration and efficacy; monitor ciclosporin 

concentration and adjust dose as necessary.
	 Hexamine hippurate: hexamine requires low urine pH for effect; there is an increased risk of 

crystalluria with sulfonamides as they are poorly soluble at low pH; avoid combination.
	 Phenytoin: sulfadiazine inhibits metabolism of phenytoin, increasing its concentration and risk of 

adverse effects; monitor phenytoin concentration and for adverse effects; decrease phenytoin dose 
if necessary.

Notes: Some preparations may contain chlorhexidine 0.2%.
Apply with sterile gloved hands or spatula in a 3–5 mm layer.
Chlorhexidine (cation) is inactivated by anionic agents such as soap; do not use together.
Silver sulfadiazine may inactivate enzymatic debriding agents.
Plasma sulfadiazine concentrations may approach therapeutic levels with side-effects and interactions 

as for sulfonamides if large areas of skin are treated.

13.3    Anti-inflammatory and antipruritic medicines
Eczema is a very common condition of infancy and childhood. Treatments include local application 
emollients, and, when needed, topical steroids. Topical steroids are available in a range of strengths 
and potencies. Treatment should be tailored to the degree of inflammation and dryness of the skin. 
Any associated infection should also be treated.

Betamethasone
ATC code: D07AC01

Cream or ointment: 0.1% (as valerate)
Special Notes: WHO age/weight restriction: hydrocortisone preferred in neonates.
This medicine is listed as a representative of its pharmacological class. Other medicines in the same 

class may have similar clinical performance and may be selected for local formularies based on 
availability and price. The information in this monograph only applies to the medicine listed here.

Indications: Severe inflammatory skin conditions.
Contraindications: Untreated skin infections; broken skin; rosacea; acne; perioral dermatitis; viral 

skin lesions; widespread plaque psoriasis.
Precautions: Children (avoid prolonged use and use under specialist supervision); psoriasis (may 

precipitate severe pustular psoriasis on withdrawal); adrenal suppression if used on a large area 
of the body or for a long time, particularly with an occlusive dressing; use on the face or groin; 
secondary infection requires treatment with an appropriate antimicrobial.

Use of more than 100 g per week of 0.1% preparation likely to cause adrenal suppression.

Administration:
Note Use the smallest amount for the shortest period of time to avoid adverse effects. Reduce use once 
improvement occurs. Discontinue use once control is achieved. Reassess diagnosis if no improvement is seen 
within 2 weeks.
Severe inflammatory skin conditions.  

Topical:  
Child apply a small quantity to the affected area one to two times daily.

Renal impairment: Dose reduction not required.
Hepatic impairment: Dose reduction not required.
Adverse effects: Common Folliculitis, steroid rosacea, perioral dermatitis, skin atrophy, 

delayed wound healing, dilatation of superficial blood vessels, formation of striae, purpura, 
depigmentation, telangiectasia, acneiform eruptions at site of application.

Uncommon Allergic contact dermatitis.

WHO Model Formulary for Children 2010	 329



13	 Dermatological medicines (topical)
Rare Hyperaesthesia, subcutaneous tissue atrophy, hypertrichosis, systemic effects (growth 

retardation, hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis suppression with prolonged or widespread use 
(particularly under occlusion), hyperglycaemia, Cushing syndrome, cataract, glaucoma).

Interactions with other medicines (* indicates severe):
Use of topical corticosteroids is less likely to result in drug interactions than systemic use, but 

interactions may occur rarely.
	 Acetylsalicylic acid: corticosteroids may decrease salicylate concentration when high-dose 

acetylsalicylic acid is used, e.g. in Kawasaki disease; monitor salicylate concentration and 
clinical effect; increase acetylsalicylic acid dose if necessary; be particularly careful to reduce the 
acetylsalicylic acid dose when withdrawing the corticosteroid.

	 NSAIMs: oral corticosteroids increase risk of gastric ulceration with NSAIMs; consider need for 
an NSAIM carefully; if an NSAIM cannot be avoided, use lowest effective dose for shortest period 
of time.

	 Rifampicin: increased metabolism of corticosteroid and may reduce activity; monitor clinical 
effect and increase corticosteroid dose if needed.

	 Warfarin: corticosteroids may increase warfarin’s anticoagulant effect, increasing the risk of 
bleeding; monitor INR and decrease warfarin dose if necessary.

Notes: Occlusive, wet dressings (never plastic) may be used if condition is severe.
Tachyphylaxis may occur. Use minimum amount necessary to control symptoms. Intermittent use 

(i.e. 2 days on, 2 days off) may at times be appropriate.
Consider bone mineral density assessment for children receiving large and long-term doses of topical 

corticosteroids.
Dermatologist consultation advisable if using on the face.

There are currently no medicines in this section of the 2nd WHO Model List of Essential Medicines for 
Children.

13.5    Medicines affecting skin differentiation and 
proliferation

Acne vulgaris
Acne typically first appears during puberty when androgenic stimulation triggers excessive produc-
tion of sebum.
Mild acne usually responds to topical therapy alone and heals without scarring. In moderate acne, 
where there are more extensive pustules causing mild scarring, oral antibiotics such as a tetracycline 
or erythromycin (section 6.2.2) are commonly used. Severe acne is a distressing condition that may 
warrant further treatment with systemic medications under specialist supervision.

332	 WHO Model Formulary for Children 2010



13.5    Medicines affecting skin differentiation and proliferation

Psoriasis
Psoriasis can occur at any age. Various biological events may trigger psoriasis, such as streptococcal 
or viral infection, psychological stress or medication (e.g. beta-blockers, chloroquine, lithium and 
NSAIMs).
Management of psoriasis depends on the site and extent of the disease and the age of the child.

Warts
Warts are common, benign and self-limiting. When required, warts can often be effectively treated 
through application of a keratolytic agent such as salicylic acid, taking care to protect the surround-
ing skin. Podophyllum resin is an alternative agent. 

Benzoyl peroxide
ATC code: D10AE01

Cream or lotion: 5%
Indications: Mild to moderate acne; adjunct to oral therapy in more severe cases.
Precautions: Avoid contact with eyes, mouth, and mucous membranes; avoid use of occlusive 

dressings; avoid excessive exposure to sunlight; may bleach fabrics, hair and skin.

Administration:
Acne.  

Topical:  
Child initially apply to clean skin on alternate days, increasing frequency to one to two times 
daily as tolerance to irritant effect develops.

Renal impairment: Dose reduction not required.
Hepatic impairment: Dose reduction not required.
Adverse effects: Common Initial irritation but subsides with continued use (in some cases may need 

to reduce frequency or temporarily suspend use), skin dryness or peeling, feeling of warmth, mild 
stinging or erythema.

Rare Contact sensitivity occurs, occasionally even one application can cause severe irritation.
Interactions with other medicines (* indicates severe):
There are no known interactions involving a significant change in effect or where it is recommended 

to avoid concomitant use.
Notes: If acne does not respond after 2 months then use of a topical antibacterial should be 

considered.
Cleanse skin before applying and gently pat dry.
Apply a thin layer to the affected area and rub in gently. Wash hands after application.
Avoid contact with eyes, lips and other sensitive areas.
Avoid contact with hair and coloured fabric as bleaching or discoloration may occur.

psoriasis.
Indications: Psoriasis.
Contraindications: Inflamed, broken or infected skin; pustular psoriasis; presence of infection.
Precautions: Avoid eyes, mucosa, genital or rectal areas; skin protection possibly required to reduce 

photosensitivity reactions; may stain skin, hair (especially fair, bleached or grey hair) and clothing.

Administration:
Psoriasis.  

Topical:  
Child apply 1–3 times daily. A solution more dilute than 5% may be preferable to start. 
Coal tar bath:  
Child use 100 ml of solution in an adult-size bath of tepid water (proportionally less for a child’s 
bath) and soak for 10–20 minutes; use once daily to once every 3 days for at least 10 baths.

Renal impairment: No dose reduction required.
Hepatic impairment: No dose reduction required.
Adverse effects: Common Mild stinging.
Rare Sterile folliculitis, irritant reactions, allergic reactions, photosensitivity, acne-like eruptions, 

hypersensitivity, skin, hair and fabrics discoloured.
Carcinogenicity Evidence is conflicting. Some epidemiological studies have raised the possibility of skin 
malignancies in patients with psoriasis with very high exposure to tar and/or ultraviolet radiation. Other studies 
have found no conclusive evidence of this.
Interactions with other medicines (* indicates severe):
There are no known interactions involving a significant change in effect or where it is recommended 

to avoid concomitant use.
Notes: Coal tar solutions are usually extemporaneous preparations and can be prepared in different 

strengths. Different strengths of solution should be available on request from compounding 
pharmacies.

Coal tar is often alternated with ultraviolet (UVB) rays, allowing at least 24 hours between exposure 
and treatment with coal tar.

13.6    Scabicides and pediculicides
Scabies
Scabies is caused by a mite, Sarcoptes scabiei, that burrows into the skin. It is readily transmitted from 
person to person, and therefore the entire household must be treated at the same time to prevent  
re-infection. Although it is not necessary to take a bath before treatment with an acaricide, all  
clothing and bedding should be washed to prevent reinfection.

Pediculosis (lice)
Pediculosis of the head and body is caused by Pediculus humanus capitis and Pediculus humanus  
corporis, respectively. Pubic lice (crab lice) infestations are caused by Pthirus pubis, which may also 
affect the eyelashes and brows. All are transmitted by person-to-person contact, and may also  
contaminate clothing and bedding. All members of the affected household (and sexual contacts) 
must be treated at the same time, and clothing and bedding should be washed or exposed to the air; 
in head lice infestations, hair brushes and combs should also be disinfected.

15	 Disinfectants and antiseptics

15.2    Disinfectants
A disinfectant is a chemical agent that does not necessarily kill all microorganisms present, but 
reduces them to a level which does not harm health or the quality of perishable goods.
Disinfection of water can be either physical (boiling, filtration, UV irradiation) or chemical. Chemical 
methods include the use of chlorine-based compounds, such as sodium hypochlorite, tosylchloramide 
sodium (chloramine), halazone or sodium dichloroisocyanurate. Chlorine is a hazardous substance, 
being highly corrosive in concentrated solution, and splashes can cause burns and can damage the 
eyes. Appropriate precautions must be taken when concentrated chlorine solutions or powders are 
handled.

Chlorine base compound
ATC code: D08AX

Powder: (0.1% available chlorine) for solution
Special Notes: Concentrations ranging from 0.01% (100 parts per million (ppm)) to 1% (10 000 

ppm) free chlorine depending on use.
This medicine is listed as a representative of its pharmacological class. Other medicines in the same 

class may have similar clinical performance and may be selected for local formularies based on 
availability and price. The information in this monograph only applies to the medicine listed here.

Indications: Disinfection of surfaces, equipment and water.
Contraindications: Avoid exposure of product to flame.
Precautions: Hypochlorite solutions may delay wound healing.

Administration:
Surface disinfection (minor contamination). 

Apply solutions containing 500–1000 ppm (0.05–0.1%) to clean surfaces.  
5000 ppm (0.5%) for blood spills.

Instrument disinfection. 
Soak in solution containing 1000 ppm (0.1%) for a minimum of 15 minutes; to avoid 
corrosion, do not soak for more than 30 minutes; rinse with sterile water.

Renal impairment: Dose reduction not necessary.
Hepatic impairment: Dose reduction not necessary.
Adverse effects: Uncommon Irritation and burning sensation on skin.
Interactions with other medicines (* indicates severe):
The antimicrobial activity of chlorine base compounds is rapidly reduced in the presence of organic 

material; it is also pH dependent. Avoid mixing with solutions of strong acids or ammonia; the 
subsequent reactions can release toxic gases.

Notes: Broad-spectrum antimicrobial with sporicidal activity (at optimum pH 7.6). Corrosive to 
metals with repeated application. Deteriorates with exposure to light and heat. Shelf life of diluted 
ingredients < 7 days.

SECTION 16:
Diuretics

WHO Model Formulary for Children 2010	 351



16	 Diuretics

16	 Diuretics
Diuretics increase urinary excretion of water and electrolytes, and are used to relieve oedema associated 
with heart failure, pulmonary oedema, glomerulonephritis and hepatic cirrhosis. Some diuretics are 
used at lower doses to reduce raised blood pressure. Osmotic diuretics are used to treat cerebral  
oedema and to lower raised intraocular pressure. Care is advised with use of diuretics in children, 
given the difficulty of fluid and electrolyte maintenance, particularly in neonates, whose renal function 
may be immature.

Furosemide
ATC code: C03CA01

Injection: 10 mg/ml in 2 ml ampoule
Oral liquid: 4 mg/ml
Tablet: 40 mg

To avoid ototoxicity, intravenous doses should be given no faster than 0.5 mg/kg per minute 
(doses < 120 mg) or 4 mg/minute (doses ≥ 120 mg).

Special Notes: Also referred to as frusemide.
Indications: Oedema; oliguric renal failure.
Contraindications: Renal failure with anuria; precomatose states associated with liver cirrhosis.
Precautions: Monitor electrolytes, particularly potassium and sodium; hypotension; renal 

impairment; hepatic impairment.

Dose:
Oedema in heart failure.  

Oral:   
Neonate 0.5–2 mg/kg every 12–24 hours (every 24 hours if corrected age under 31 weeks).  
Infant or Child 0.5–2 mg/kg 2–3 times daily; higher doses may be required in resistant oedema, 
maximum 12 mg/kg (80 mg) daily. 
IV:   
Neonate 0.5–1 mg/kg every 12–24 hours (every 24 hours if corrected age under 31 weeks).  
Infant or Child 0.5–1 mg/kg (maximum 4 mg/kg) repeated every 8 hours as necessary.

Oliguric renal failure.  
IV injection:  
Infant or Child 2–5 mg/kg (maximum 250 mg) up to four times daily.

Renal impairment: Contraindicated in anuria.
Higher doses are usually required in impairment; renal function may worsen; monitor electrolytes 

and creatinine. Risk of ototoxicity increased.
Treatment with nephrotoxic drugs increases risk of nephrotoxicity with loop diuretics; use 

combinations carefully, especially in renal impairment.
Hepatic impairment: Hypokalaemia may precipitate coma (use potassium-sparing diuretic to prevent 

this).
Adverse effects: Most adverse effects are dose-related.
Common Hyponatraemia, hypokalaemia, hypomagnesaemia, dehydration, hyperuricaemia, gout, 

dizziness, orthostatic hypotension, syncope.
Uncommon Dyslipidaemia, increased creatinine concentration, hypocalcaemia, rash.

17	 Gastrointestinal medicines
Pancreatic enzymes
Pancreatic enzymes are combinations of enzymes (proteases, lipases and amylases), in varying proportions,  
which aid the digestion of food products. They are taken orally with food, as replacement for natural 
pancreatic enzymes when they are deficient. Deficiency can occur in diseases such as cystic fibrosis 
or after removal of the pancreas. Specialist advice is recommended when considering the use of these 
medicines.

Gastro-oesophageal reflux disease
Gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GORD) is associated with symptoms which include heartburn, 
acid regurgitation and sometimes difficulty in swallowing (dysphagia); ulceration and stricture 
formation may occur. The management of GORD is age-dependent. Most symptoms in infants 
resolve without treatment, but for older children, management involves lifestyle changes (see above), 
and medications as necessary.

Pancreatic enzymes
ATC code: A09AA; A09AA02

Age-appropriate formulations and doses including lipase, protease and amylase
Indications: Reduced or absent exocrine secretion in cystic fibrosis, following pancreatectomy, total 

gastrectomy or chronic pancreatitis.
Contraindications: Acute pancreatitis; acute exacerbations of chronic pancreatic disease.
Precautions: Higher strength preparations have been associated with the development of large bowel 

strictures (fibrosing colonopathy); hyperuricaemia and hyperuricosuria have been associated with very high 
doses; history of fibrosing colonopathy; history of or pre-existing intestinal blockage; hyperuricaemia.

Dose:
Dose must be individualized and is guided by stool quality and quantity. Specialist supervision is 

recommended. 
Daily dose should not exceed 10 000 lipase units per kg body weight per day.

Renal impairment: Dose reduction not necessary.
Hepatic impairment: Dose reduction not necessary.
Adverse effects: Common Nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain.
Uncommon Irritation of skin around mouth and anus.
Rare Hyperuricaemia, hyperuricuria, fibrosing colonopathy (bowel stricture) in children with cystic 

fibrosis taking high doses.
Interactions with other medicines (* indicates severe):
Avoid placing contents of opened capsules on alkaline foods (pH > 5.5) such as dairy products (milk, 

custard or ice cream).
There are no known drug interactions where it is recommended to avoid concomitant use.
Notes: Pancreatic enzymes are essential for fat, carbohydrate and protein digestion. Supplements aim 

to correct enzymatic deficiency.
All products are of porcine origin.
Pancreatic enzymes are inactivated by gastric acid. It is best to administer with food (or immediately 

before or after food).

WHO Model Formulary for Children 2010	 359



17	 Gastrointestinal medicines
Do not crush or chew the capsule or granules.
It is best to swallow capsule whole with a glass of water.
If the capsules are opened the enteric-coated granules should be mixed (do not crush) with slightly 

acidic cool soft food or liquid such as apple sauce or puree, mashed fruits or rice cereal. Mixture 
should be administered immediately. Do not prepare ahead of time.

Pancreatic enzymes are inactivated by heat: excessive heat should be avoided if preparations are mixed 
with liquids or food.

Pancreatic enzymes can irritate the perioral skin and buccal mucosa if retained in the mouth and 
excessive doses can cause perianal irritation.

If any patient on pancreatic enzyme supplementation develops new abdominal symptoms (or change 
in existing abdominal symptoms) the patient should be reviewed to exclude the possibility of 
colonic damage.

17.1    Antacids and other antiulcer medicines
Antacids often relieve symptoms in ulcer dyspepsia and GORD. H2-receptor antagonists heal gastric 
and duodenal ulceration and relieve GORD by reducing the secretion of gastric acid through  
histamine H2-receptor blockade. Proton-pump inhibitors inhibit gastric acid secretion by blocking 
the hydrogen–potassium ATP enzyme system (proton pump) of the gastric parietal cell.

Tablet: 500 mg

Indications: Ulcer and non-ulcer dyspepsia; gastro-oesophageal reflux; hyperphosphataemia.
Contraindications: Hypophosphataemia; undiagnosed gastrointestinal or rectal bleeding; 

appendicitis; porphyria; neonates and infants.
Precautions: Impaired renal function; renal dialysis; hepatic impairment; constipation; dehydration; 

fluid restriction; gastrointestinal disorders associated with decreased bowel motility or obstruction.

Dose:
Dyspepsia; gastro-oesophageal reflux. 

Oral:  
Child 6–12 years 5 ml (= 320 mg) up to three times daily.

Hyperphosphataemia. 
Oral:  
Child 5–12 years 500–1000 mg of aluminium hydroxide three times daily adjusted as necessary; 
or 
over 5 years 30 mg/kg/day in divided doses three or four times/day, maximum daily dose 
3000 mg/day.

every 3 months.
Hepatic impairment: Use with caution. Side effect of constipation may precipitate hepatic 

encephalopathy and coma.
Adverse effects: Common Constipation.
Uncommon Hypophosphataemia.
Rare Intestinal obstruction, hypercalciuria, hyperaluminaemia, osteomalacia, proximal myopathy, 

encephalopathy, anaemia, dementia.
Interactions with other medicines (* indicates severe):
Note Antacids should preferably not be taken at the same time as other drugs since they may impair 
absorption.

17.5    Medicines used in diarrhoea
Diarrhoea remains a leading cause of death among infants and young children, particularly in 
developing countries. It is estimated that more than three quarters of all deaths from diarrhoea could 
be prevented with universal availability and utilization of oral rehydration solution (ORS) and zinc.

WHO Model Formulary for Children 2010	 369



17	 Gastrointestinal medicines

17.5.1	 Oral rehydration
Acute diarrhoea in children should always be treated with ORS, according to their degree of  
dehydration, following one of three management plans (see Oral rehydration solution monograph).

Oral rehydration salts
ATC code: A07CA

Powder for dilution in 200 ml; 500 ml; 1 litre 
Contains: glucose 13.5 g/l, sodium chloride 2.6 g/l, potassium chloride 1.5 g/l, trisodium citrate 
dihydrate 2.9 g/l 
Provides: glucose 75 mmol/l, sodium 75 mEq or mmol/l, chloride 65 mEq or mmol/l, potassium 
20 mEq or mmol/l, citrate 10 mmol/l, osmolarity 245 mOsm/l

Special Notes: Oral rehydration salts are also referred to as ORS.
Known by the brand names Gastrolyte and Dioralyte.
Indications: Oral rehydration salts replace fluid and salts lost in acute diarrhoea.
Precautions: Renal impairment. 

Dose:
WHO Recommends Plans A, B and C; see below.
Plan A: no dehydration Nutritional advice, increased fluid intake (e.g. unsalted soup, 

unsalted rice water, yoghurt or plain water), at least one fluid that normally contains salt (e.g. 
ORS solution, salted drinks including salted rice water and vegetable or chicken soup with salt) 
and zinc supplementation (section 17.5.2) at home are usually sufficient. The aim is to give as 
much nutrient-rich food as the child will accept. Breastfeeding should always be continued to 
reduce the risk of diminishing supply. Give as much fluid as the child wants until diarrhoea 
stops and, as a guide, after each loose stool give: 
Child under 2 years 50–100 ml (a quarter to half a large cup) of fluid; 
2–10 years 100–200 ml (a half to one large cup); 
older than 10 years as much fluid as the child wants. 
Parents should be advised about circumstances in which they should seek further advice.

Plan B: moderate dehydration Whatever the child’s age, a 4 hour treatment plan is 
applied to avoid short-term problems. It is recommended that parents are shown how to give 
approximately 75 ml/kg of oral rehydration solution over a 4 hour period, and it is suggested 
that parents should be watched to see how they cope at the beginning of the treatment. A larger 
amount of solution (up to 20 ml/kg/hour and maximum 750 ml/hour) can be given if the child 
continues to have frequent stools or if the child wants more than the estimated amount of ORS 
solution, and there are no signs of overhydration (e.g. oedematous eyelids). In case of vomiting, 
rehydration must be discontinued for 10 minutes and then resumed at a slower rate. In younger 
children, breastfeeding should be continued on demand and the mother should be encouraged 
to do so; older children should receive milk and nutritious food as normal after completing 
the 4 hours of oral rehydration. The child’s status must be reassessed after 4 hours to decide on 
the most appropriate subsequent treatment. If signs of dehydration worsen, shift to treatment 
plan C; and if the child develops signs of severe dehydration, intravenous rehydration should be 
started as per treatment plan C. Zinc supplementation (section 17.5.2) should begin as soon as 
the child can eat and has completed 4 hours of rehydration. Oral rehydration solution should 
continue to be offered once dehydration has been controlled, for as long as the child continues 
to have diarrhoea. 

370	 WHO Model Formulary for Children 2010



17.5    Medicines used in diarrhoea

Plan C: severe dehydration Hospitalization is necessary, but the most urgent priority 
is to start rehydration. The preferred treatment for children with severe dehydration is rapid 
intravenous rehydration. In hospital (or elsewhere), if the child can drink, oral rehydration 
solution should be given during the intravenous rehydration (20 ml/kg/hour by mouth before 
infusion, then 5 ml/kg/hour by mouth during intravenous rehydration). For intravenous 
rehydration, it is recommended that compound solution of sodium lactate (or, if this is 
unavailable, sodium chloride 0.9% intravenous infusion) (see section 26.2) is administered at a 
rate adapted to the child’s age. 
Intravenous rehydration using compound sodium lactate solution or sodium chloride 0.9% 
infusion  
IV:  
Infant 30 ml/kg over 1 hour, then 14 ml/kg/hour for 5 hours. 
Child 30 ml/kg over 30 minutes, then 28 ml/kg/hour for 2.5 hours. 
If the intravenous route is unavailable, a nasogastric tube is also suitable for administering oral 
rehydration solution. 
Nasogastric rehydration using oral rehydration solution  
Nasogastric tube:  
Infant or Child 20 ml/kg/hour for 6 hours (total 120 ml/kg). 
If the child vomits, the rate of administration of the oral solution should be reduced. Reassess 
the child’s status after 3 hours (6 hours for infants) and continue treatment as appropriate with 
plan A, B or C.

Renal impairment: Dose reduction may be necessary; monitor electrolytes carefully.
Hepatic impairment: Dose reduction not necessary.
Adverse effects: Common or uncommon Vomiting may indicate too rapid administration, 

hypernatraemia and hyperkalaemia may result from overdose in renal impairment or 
administration of too concentrated a solution.

Interactions with other medicines (* indicates severe):
There are no known interactions where it is recommended to avoid concomitant use.
Notes: Trisodium citrate dihydrate may be replaced by sodium hydrogen carbonate (sodium 

bicarbonate) 2.5 g/l. However, as the stability of this latter formulation is very poor under tropical 
conditions, it is only recommended when manufactured for immediate use.

Glucose salt solution:
sodium chloride 2.6 g/l of clean water
sodium citrate (dihydrate) 2.9 g/l of clean water
potassium chloride 1.5 g/l of clean water
glucose (anhydrous) 13.5 g/l of clean water.
When glucose and sodium citrate are not available, they may be replaced by:
sucrose (common sugar) 27 g/l of clean water
sodium bicarbonate 2.5 g/l of clean water.
Note The solution may be prepared either from prepackaged sugar/salt mixtures or from bulk substances 
and water. Solutions must be freshly prepared, preferably with recently boiled and cooled water. Accurate 
weighing and thorough mixing and dissolution of ingredients in the correct volume of clean water is important. 
Administration of more concentrated solutions can result in hypernatraemia.

17	 Gastrointestinal medicines

17.5.2	 Medicines for diarrhoea in children
Zinc supplementation is used in combination with ORS for the management of acute diarrhoea in 
children. When given during an acute episode, zinc supplements reduce the severity and duration of 
the episode, as well as reducing the incidence of new episodes of diarrhoea in the 2–3 months follow-
ing treatment.

Zinc sulfate
ATC code: A12CB01

Oral liquid: in 10 mg per unit dosage forms
Tablet: in 10 mg per unit dosage forms

Indications: Adjunct to oral rehydration therapy in acute diarrhoea.
Precautions: Acute renal failure (may accumulate).

Dose:
Adjunct to oral rehydration therapy in acute diarrhoea. 

Oral:  
Infant under 6 months 10 mg (elemental zinc) daily for 10–14 days. 
Infant or Child over 6 months 20 mg (elemental zinc) daily for 10–14 days.

Renal impairment: May accumulate in acute renal failure.
Hepatic impairment: Dose reduction not necessary.
Adverse effects: Uncommon Abdominal pain, dyspepsia, nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, gastric 

irritation, gastritis, irritability, headache, lethargy.
Interactions with other medicines (* indicates severe):
	 Calcium salts: reduced absorption of zinc sulfate.
	 Ciprofloxacin: reduced absorption of ciprofloxacin.
	 Ferrous salts: absorption of zinc and of oral ferrous salts reduced.
	 Ofloxacin: reduced absorption of ofloxacin.
	 Penicillamine: absorption of both drugs reduced.
Notes: Zinc sulfate tablets may be dispersed in breast milk, in oral rehydration solution or in water 

on a small spoon; older children may chew tablets or swallow them with water.
Administer with food if gastrointestinal upset occurs.

18	 Hormones, other endocrine medicines and 
contraceptives

18.1    Adrenal hormones and synthetic substitutes
Corticosteroids include hormones secreted by the adrenal cortex (hydrocortisone and aldosterone) 
and synthetic analogues of these hormones. In physiological (low) doses, corticosteroids replace deficient  
endogenous hormones. In pharmacological (high) doses, glucocorticoids decrease inflammation and 
suppress the immune response. Side-effects of systemic glucocorticoids are dose and duration  
dependent, therefore patients should be given treatment for the shortest period at the lowest dose 
that is clinically necessary. After prolonged therapy, or if there is uncertainty about adrenal suppression, 
withdrawal should be gradual to enable the adrenal gland to recover. Patients should be advised not 
to stop taking glucocorticoids abruptly unless permitted by their doctor.

Fludrocortisone
ATC code: H02AA02

Tablet: 100 micrograms
Indications: Mineralocorticoid replacement in adrenocortical insufficiency.
Contraindications: Congestive cardiac failure; systemic fungal infections.
Precautions: Dosage should be tapered gradually if therapy is discontinued; use with caution in 

patients with hypertension, oedema or renal impairment.

Dose:
Mineralocorticoid replacement in adrenocortical insufficiency. 

Oral:  
Neonate initially 100 micrograms once daily. Maintenance dose 50–300 micrograms daily. 
Adjust dose according to response. 
Infant or Child initially 50–100 micrograms once daily. Maintenance dose 50–300 micrograms 
once daily. Adjust dose according to response.

Renal impairment: Use with caution. Dose reduction not necessary.
Hepatic impairment: Dose reduction not necessary.
Adverse effects: When used as mineralocorticoid replacement, adverse effects usually indicate that 

the dose (and/or salt intake) is too high.
Common Sodium and water retention, oedema, hypokalaemia, hypertension.
Rare Hypokalaemic alkalosis, heart failure.
Interactions with other medicines (* indicates severe):
Systemic corticosteroids (such as fludrocortisone) reduce potassium concentration and increase risk 

of hypokalaemia. Administration with other drugs which also reduce potassium concentration may 
increase this risk; monitor potassium concentration and give supplements if necessary.

	 Phenytoin: increases metabolism of fludrocortisone and may reduce its activity; monitor clinical 
effect and increase corticosteroid dose if necessary (large increases may be needed). Metabolism of 
phenytoin may be affected.

	 Rifampicin: increases metabolism of fludrocortisone and may reduce its activity; monitor clinical 
effect and increase corticosteroid dose if needed (may need to double dose).

	 Warfarin: fludrocortisone may increase warfarin’s anticoagulant effect, increasing the risk of 
bleeding; monitor INR and decrease warfarin dose if necessary.

ATC code: H02AB09 

Tablet: 5 mg; 10 mg; 20 mg

Hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis suppression may occur, acute adrenal insufficiency 
(adrenal crisis) may occur with abrupt withdrawal after long-term therapy (longer than 3 weeks) 
or with stress; withdrawal and discontinuation of steroids should be performed carefully; 
patients with HPA axis suppression may require doses of systemic glucocorticosteroids prior 
to, during and after unusual stress (e.g. surgery). Immunosuppression may occur; patients may 
be more susceptible to infections; avoid exposure to chickenpox and measles. Corticosteroids 
may activate latent opportunistic infections or exacerbate systemic fungal infections. May cause 
osteoporosis (at any age) or inhibition of bone growth in paediatric patients. Acute myopathy 
may occur with high doses, elevated intraocular pressure may occur (especially with prolonged 
use), and CNS effects (ranging from euphoria to psychosis) may occur.

Indications: Congenital adrenal hyperplasia; Addison disease; adrenal hypoplasia; chronic 
maintenance or replacement therapy.

Contraindications: Systemic infection (unless specific therapy given); avoid live virus vaccines in 
patients receiving immunosuppressive doses.

Precautions: Avoid using higher than recommended dose; titrate to lowest effective dose; adrenal 
suppression; abrupt withdrawal; peptic ulcer disease; psychiatric disorders; glaucoma; osteoporosis; 
myasthenia gravis; infection; growth restriction; hypertension; congestive heart failure; hepatic 
impairment; renal impairment; diabetes mellitus; ocular herpes simplex; epilepsy; hypothyroidism; 
history of steroid myopathy; ulcerative colitis; diverticulitis; recent intestinal anastomoses; 
thromboembolic disorders; latent tuberculosis.

When used in the treatment of adrenal insufficiency, these precautions may not apply; seek specialist 
advice.

Dose:
Congenital adrenal hyperplasia.  

Oral:  
Neonate 6–7 mg/m2 every 8 hours, adjusted according to response.  
Infant or Child 5–6.5 mg/m2 every 8 hours, adjusted according to response. Usual maintenance 
dose is 4–5 mg/m2 every 8 hours but higher doses may be needed.

Note Administer morning doses as early as possible.
Addison disease, adrenal hypoplasia, chronic maintenance or replacement therapy.  

Oral:  
Neonate, Infant or Child usual dose 4–5 mg/m2 every 8 hours. Higher doses may be needed.

Note Give larger doses in the morning and smaller doses in the evening.
Renal impairment: Use with caution. Dose reduction not necessary.
Hepatic impairment: Adverse effects are more common.
Adverse effects: When used as mineralocorticoid replacement, adverse effects usually indicate that 

the dose (and/or salt intake) is too high.

18.5    Insulins and other antidiabetic agents
Type 1 (insulin-dependent) diabetes mellitus is due to a deficiency of insulin caused by autoimmune 
destruction of pancreatic beta cells. Patients require lifelong administration of insulin. Type 1 diabetes 
mellitus forms the majority of cases of diabetes in children.
Type 2 (non-insulin dependent) diabetes mellitus is due to reduced secretion of, or peripheral 
resistance to the action of, insulin. Sometimes patients may be managed with diet and exercise alone, 
although treatment may also be required. The aim of treatment is to achieve the best possible control 
of blood glucose concentration without causing hypoglycaemia, as well as preventing or minimizing 
long-term complications.

Insulin
Appropriate insulin regimens should be worked out for each patient. Insulin requirements and 
plasma glucose concentrations may be affected by variations in lifestyle (diet and exercise). The 
duration of action of different insulin preparations varies considerably from one patient to another, 
and this needs to be assessed for every individual. Guidelines for management of diabetes should be 
consulted, and possible complications of treatment should be considered.

Insulin injection (soluble)
ATC code: A10AB

Injection: 100 IU/ml in 10 ml vial
Indications: Diabetes mellitus; diabetic emergencies and at surgery; diabetic ketoacidosis or coma.
Precautions: Acute trauma or illness: insulin requirement may increase.
Surgery: monitor blood glucose and urine ketones perioperatively; insulin infusion may be required 

in complex or prolonged surgery.

WHO Model Formulary for Children 2010	 377



18	 Hormones, other endocrine medicines and contraceptives

Dose:
Hyperglycaemia, surgery in children with diabetes.  

IV infusion:  
Neonate 0.01–0.1 units/kg/hour, adjusted according to blood glucose concentration. Start at 
lower rate and monitor closely; neonates are very sensitive to insulin. 
Infant or Child 0.025–0.1 units/kg/hour, adjusted according to blood glucose concentration.

Diabetes mellitus.  
SC:  
Neonate, Infant or Child according to requirements.

Diabetic ketoacidosis or coma.  
IV infusion:  
Infant or Child 0.05–0.1 units/kg/hour (maximum 0.2 units/kg/hour) depending on the rate of 
reduction of serum glucose (decreasing the serum glucose level too rapidly may lead to cerebral 
oedema), until acidosis is corrected and patient is resumed on subcutaneous insulin.

Renal impairment: May need dose reduction; insulin requirements fall; compensatory response to 
hypoglycaemia is impaired.

Hepatic impairment: Dose reduction not necessary.
Adverse effects: Common Hypoglycaemia (see below), weight gain, hypokalaemia when given 

without potassium in the treatment of diabetic ketoacidosis.
Uncommon Allergic reactions, local reactions including erythema, itching, lipodystrophy, 

lipoatrophy.
Hypoglycaemia The most frequent and serious adverse effect of insulin therapy; may occur with excessive 
dosage, delayed or insufficient food, increased physical activity. Warning symptoms include sweating, hunger, 
faintness, palpitations, tremor, headache, visual disturbance and altered mood.
Interactions with other medicines (* indicates severe):
	 Dexamethasone: antagonism of hypoglycaemic effect.
	 Enalapril: hypoglycaemic effect possibly enhanced.
	 Ethanol: enhanced hypoglycaemic effect.
	 Furosemide: antagonism of hypoglycaemic effect.
	 Hydrochlorothiazide: antagonism of hypoglycaemic effect.
	 Hydrocortisone: antagonism of hypoglycaemic effect.
	 Prednisolone: antagonism of hypoglycaemic effect.
	 Propranolol: enhanced hypoglycaemic effect; propranolol may mask warning signs of 

hypoglycaemia such as tremor.
Notes: For maintenance regimes it is usual to inject 15–30 minutes before meals.
When injected subcutaneously, soluble insulin has a rapid onset of action (30–60 minutes), a peak 

action between 2 and 4 hours, and a duration of action of up to 8 hours.
When injected intravenously, soluble insulin has a very short half-life of only about 5 minutes and its 

effect disappears within 30 minutes.
If changing from intravenous to subcutaneous insulin, do not stop the intravenous infusion until 

30–60 minutes after the subcutaneous dose (to allow time for effect).
Administration For intravenous infusion, dilute to a concentration of 1 unit/ml, with sodium chloride 
0.9% and mix thoroughly; insulin may be adsorbed by plastics, flush giving set with 5 ml of infusion fluid 
containing insulin.
Patients need to be instructed to rotate the subcutaneous injection site to avoid fat necrosis (lipoatrophy) and 
erratic absorption. Can be a particular problem in children because lipoatrophic area less painful to inject into 
than normal areas.
Refrigerate unopened vials of insulin at 2–8 °C. Once opened vials may be stored in refrigerator or at 

room temperature for up to 28 days. Only use soluble insulin if it is clear and not cloudy.

18.8    Thyroid hormones and antithyroid medicines
Thyroid hormones
Thyroid agents are natural or synthetic agents containing levothyroxine (thyroxine) or liothyronine 
(tri-iodothyronine). They increase the metabolic rate and exert a cardiostimulatory effect. Neonatal 
hypothyroidism requires prompt treatment for normal development. Dosage should be titrated 
according to clinical response, growth assessment and measurement of plasma thyroxine and 
thyroid-stimulating hormone. 

Levothyroxine
ATC code: H03AA01

Tablet: 25 micrograms;  50 micrograms; 100 micrograms (sodium salt)
Special Notes: Also known as thyroxine sodium, thyroxine and T4.
Indications: Hypothyroidism.
Contraindications: Thyrotoxicosis; uncorrected adrenal insufficiency.
Precautions: Panhypopituitarism or predisposition to adrenal insufficiency (initiate corticosteroid 

therapy before starting levothyroxine); cardiovascular disorders (pre-therapy ECG may be 
valuable); long-standing hypothyroidism; diabetes insipidus; diabetes mellitus (dose of diabetic 
drugs including insulin may need to be increased).

18.8    Thyroid hormones and antithyroid medicines

Dose:
Hyperthyroidism (including Graves disease), thyrotoxic crisis, thyrotoxicosis.  

Adjust dosage to maintain T3, T4 and TSH in normal range; elevated T3 may be sole indicator 
of inadequate treatment. Elevated TSH indicates excessive antithyroid treatment.  
Oral:  
Neonate initially 2.5–5 mg/kg twice daily until euthyroid. Adjusted as necessary; higher doses 
occasionally required, particularly in thyrotoxic crisis.  
Infant initially 2.5 mg/kg three times daily until euthyroid. Adjusted as necessary; higher doses 
occasionally required, particularly in thyrotoxic crisis. 
Child 1–5 years initially 25 mg three times daily until euthyroid. Adjusted as necessary; higher 
doses occasionally required, particularly in thyrotoxic crisis;  
5–12 years initially 50 mg three times daily until euthyroid. Adjusted as necessary; higher doses 
occasionally required, particularly in thyrotoxic crisis.

Note Maintenance dosage to maintain euthyroid state is commonly 30–60% of the initial dose.
Renal impairment: Mild to moderate: use 75% of the normal dose.
Severe: use 50% of the normal dose.
Hepatic impairment: Withdraw treatment if hepatic function deteriorates (fatal reactions reported).
Adverse effects: Occur most often during the first 8 weeks of treatment. Itching and mild rashes may 

respond to antihistamines while continuing treatment.
Common Itching, rash, mild leukopenia, nausea, vomiting, gastric discomfort, headache, arthralgia.
Rare Agranulocytosis (see below), hypoprothrombinaemia and bleeding, myositis, hepatotoxicity (see 

below), vasculitis, lupus-like syndrome.
Agranulocytosis Most likely in first 3 months of treatment; its rapid onset means regular monitoring is 
of questionable value.
Hepatotoxicity Asymptomatic increases in serum aminotransferases may occur commonly during the 
first 2 months of propylthiouracil treatment, but resolve with continued treatment. Serious hepatotoxic reactions 
(usually hepatocellular hepatitis) occur rarely with propylthiouracil and may be immune-based.
Interactions with other medicines (* indicates severe):
	 Sodium iodide (iodine-131): avoid combination.
*	 Warfarin: decreased anticoagulant effect.
Notes: Patient advice Warn patient or carer to tell doctor immediately if sore throat, mouth ulcers, 
bruising, fever, malaise or non-specific illness occur.

19.1    Diagnostic agents

19	 Immunologicals
Immunity
Active immunity is acquired by administration of microorganisms or their products to induce anti-
bodies. Active immunity can be acquired by natural disease or by vaccination. Passive immunity is 
conferred by preparations made from the plasma of immune individuals.

19.1    Diagnostic agents
The tuberculin skin test (tuberculin, purified protein derivative) is a subcutaneous injection of 
purified tuberculin derivative used to identify exposure to mycobacteria, particularly Mycobacterium 
tuberculosis. The local skin reaction is ‘read’ at 72 hours post-inoculation. It is limited in its efficacy, 
given that it does not distinguish between Mycobacterium species, active and quiescent disease, or 
acquired infection and seroconversion from BCG vaccination. 

Tuberculin, purified protein derivative
ATC code: V04CF01

Injection
Special Notes: Tuberculin purified protein derivative PPD is a sterile isotonic solution of tuberculin. 

It is obtained from a human strain of Mycobacterium tuberculosis grown on a protein-free synthetic 
medium.

Tuberculin PPD is indicated as a diagnostic aid in the detection of Mycobacterium tuberculosis 
infection (Mantoux test).

Indications: Test for hypersensitivity to tuberculoprotein.
Contraindications: Should not be used within 4 weeks of receiving a live viral vaccine.
Precautions: Malnutrition; viral or bacterial infections (including HIV and severe tuberculosis); 

malignant disease; corticosteroid or immunosuppressant therapy: diminished sensitivity to 
tuberculin; avoid contact with open cuts, abraded or diseased skin, eyes or mouth.

Response to tuberculin may be suppressed by live viral vaccines, viral infection, sarcoidosis.

Dose:
Note National recommendations may vary.
Test for hypersensitivity to tuberculoprotein. 

Intradermal:  
Child all ages 5 or 10 units (1 unit may be used in hypersensitive patients or if tuberculosis is 
suspected). See Notes for method of administration.

Renal impairment: Dose reduction not necessary.
Hepatic impairment: Dose reduction not necessary.
Adverse effects: Uncommon Nausea, headache, malaise, rash, immediate local reactions (more 

common in atopic patients).
Rare Vesicular or ulcerating local reactions, regional adenopathy and fever.
Interactions with other medicines (* indicates severe):
	 Systemic steroids: may suppress the reaction to the test.
	 Live vaccines: may suppress the reaction to the test and should either be administered on the same 

day as the test or 4 weeks after.
Notes: Not for intravenous or intramuscular injection.

WHO Model Formulary for Children 2010	 387



19	 Immunologicals
Administration of the Mantoux test consists of an intradermal injection of 5 or 10 tuberculin units 

into the flexor or dorsal surface of the forearm (about 4 inches below the bend of the elbow). 
A tuberculin syringe with a ½ inch 26 or 27 gauge needle should be used to administer the test 
material. The bevel of the needle should be pointing upward and inserted into the most superficial 
layers of the skin. As the PPD is injected, a pale bleb (6–10 mm) will rise over the point of the 
needle; the bleb will disappear in minutes. If the bleb does not form, repeat the test at least 
2 inches from the original injection site. No dressing is required.

All tuberculins should comply with the Requirements for Tuberculins (Revised 1985) WHO Expert 
Committee on Biological Standardization Thirty-sixth report (WHO Technical Report Series, No. 
745, 1987, Annex 1).

February 2010).

19.2    Sera and immunoglobulins
Antibodies of human origin are usually termed immunoglobulins. Material prepared from animals 
is called antiserum. Due to serum sickness and other allergic-type reactions that may follow injections 
of antisera, this therapy has been replaced wherever possible by the use of immunoglobulins.

Contraindications, precautions and adverse reactions
Anaphylaxis, although rare, can occur and epinephrine (adrenaline) must always be available.  
Intramuscular injection of sera and immunoglobulins may cause local reactions including pain and 
tenderness. Live virus vaccines should be given either 3 weeks before or 3 months after immunoglobulin.

Antitetanus immunoglobulin (human)
ATC code: J06BB02

Injection: 500 IU in vial
Special Notes: Also referred to as tetanus immunoglobulin.
Indications: Passive immunization against tetanus as part of the management of tetanus-prone 

wounds; treatment of tetanus.
Contraindications: Thrombocytopenia (IM injection contraindicated).
Precautions: Anaphylaxis, although rare, may occur; concomitant or recent use of live virus vaccines 

(see below).
Live virus vaccines Immunoglobulins may interfere with the immune response to live virus vaccines, 
which should be administered 3 weeks before or 3 months after immunoglobulin.

Dose:
Note National recommendations may vary.
Passive immunization against tetanus as part of the management of tetanus-prone wounds. 

IM:  
Child all ages 250 units, increase to 500 units if wound older than 24 hours or there is risk of 
heavy contamination or following burns.

Treatment of tetanus. 
IV:  
Child all ages consult specialist protocols.

388	 WHO Model Formulary for Children 2010



19.2    Sera and immunoglobulins
Renal impairment: Dose reduction not necessary.
Hepatic impairment: Dose reduction not necessary.
Adverse effects: Uncommon Local reactions including pain and tenderness may occur at the site 

of IM injection. Systemic reactions following IV injection including fever, chills, facial flushing, 
headache and nausea.

Rare Hypersensitivity including anaphylaxis.
Interactions with other medicines (* indicates severe):
There are no known interactions involving a significant change in effect.
Notes: Antitetanus immunoglobulin of human origin is a preparation containing immunoglobulins 

derived from the plasma of adults immunized with tetanus toxoid. It is used for the management 
of tetanus-prone wounds in addition to wound toilet and if appropriate antibacterial prophylaxis 
and adsorbed tetanus vaccine.

Adrenaline should be available to treat anaphylaxis should it occur.
Tetanus vaccine If clinical situation requires tetanus vaccine and antitetanus immunoglobulin to be 
administered at the same time, they should be administered using separate syringes and separate sites.
Plasma fractions should comply with the WHO Requirements for the Collection, Processing and 

Quality Control of Blood, Blood Components and Plasma Derivatives (Revised 1992). WHO 
Technical Report Series No. 840, 1994, Annex 2.

Antivenom immunoglobulin
ATC code: J06AA03

Injection
Indications: Acute envenomation following snake or spider bite.
Contraindications: There are no absolute contraindications to antivenom treatment in significant 

systemic envenoming; treatment can be life saving.
A number of antivenoms are derived from rabbit, equine or ovine sources and should be used in 

caution in patients allergic to these animals, but do not withhold treatment in severe or potentially 
severe envenomation.

Precautions: Anaphylaxis, although rare, may occur; concomitant or recent use of live virus vaccines 
(see below); resuscitation facilities should be immediately available.

Live virus vaccines Immunoglobulins may interfere with the immune response to live virus vaccines 
which should be administered 3 weeks before or 3 months after immunoglobulin.

Dose:
Depends on the specific antivenom used, consult local protocol and manufacturers’ literature.
Children are at greater risk of severe envenoming because of smaller body mass and likelihood of 

physical activity immediately following a bite. Children require the same doses of antivenom 
as adults and should not be given weight-adjusted doses, which may grossly underestimate 
antivenom requirement; the amount of antivenom required depends on the amount of venom 
to be neutralized, not the weight of the patient.

Renal impairment: Dose reduction not necessary.
Hepatic impairment: Dose reduction not necessary.

WHO Model Formulary for Children 2010	 389



19	 Immunologicals
Adverse effects: Common Rash (transient), headache, hypotension, fever, anaphylaxis or 

anaphylactoid reactions (immediate or early onset), serum sickness (delayed onset, risk increases 
with volume of antivenom).

Uncommon Abdominal pain, vomiting, arthralgia, myalgia, pain at infusion site.
Interactions with other medicines (* indicates severe):
There are no known interactions involving a significant change in effect.
Notes: All plasma fractions should comply with the WHO Requirements for the Collection, 

Processing and Quality Control of Blood, Blood Components and Plasma Derivatives (Revised 
1992). WHO Expert Committee on Biological Standardization Forty-third report, WHO 
Technical Report Series, No. 840, 1994, Annex 2.

Acute envenomation from snakes or spiders is common in many parts of the world. The bite may 
cause local and systemic effects.

Local effects include pain, swelling, bruising and tender enlargement of regional lymph nodes. 
Wounds should be cleaned and pain may be relieved by analgesics.

If significant amounts of toxin are absorbed after a snake bite, this may result in early anaphylactoid 
symptoms such as transient hypotension, angioedema, abdominal colic, diarrhoea and vomiting, 
followed by persistent or recurrent hypotension and ECG abnormalities. Spontaneous systemic 
bleeding, coagulopathy, respiratory distress syndrome and acute renal failure may occur. Early 
anaphylactoid symptoms may be treated with adrenaline. Snake antivenom immunoglobulins 
are the only specific treatment available but they can produce severe adverse reactions. They are 
generally only used if there is a clear indication of systemic involvement, severe local involvement 
or, in regions where supplies are not limited, in patients at high risk of systemic or severe local 
involvement.

There are many antivenom immunoglobulins each containing specific venom-neutralizing globulins. 
It is important that the specific antivenom immunoglobulin suitable for the species causing the 
envenomation is administered.

In countries where there are a number of venomous snake species (e.g. Australia), a polyvalent 
immunoglobulin is also available to be used. This is used when the snake species is not known, 
the specific antivenom is not available or is not available in sufficient quantity to treat the 
envenomation.

Risk of anaphylactoid reaction can be reduced by adequate dilution of antivenom before infusion.
Spider bites may cause either necrotic or neurotoxic syndromes depending on the species involved. 

Supportive and symptomatic treatment is required and in the case of necrotic syndrome, surgical 
repair may be necessary. Spider antivenom immunoglobulin, suitable for the species involved, may 
prevent symptoms if administered as soon as possible after envenomation.

Diphtheria antitoxin
ATC code: J06AA01

Injection: 10 000 IU; 20 000 IU in vial
Indications: Passive immunization in suspected cases of diphtheria without waiting for bacterial 

confirmation.
Contraindications: Not to be used for primary prophylaxis of diphtheria.
Precautions: In patients allergic to horses, antitoxin should be used with caution but not withheld.

390	 WHO Model Formulary for Children 2010



19.2    Sera and immunoglobulins
Initial test dose should be given to exclude hypersensitivity; anaphylaxis, although rare, may occur; 

observation required after full dose (epinephrine and resuscitation facilities should be available); 
concomitant or recent use of live virus vaccines (see below).

Live virus vaccines Immunoglobulins may interfere with the immune response to live virus vaccines 
which should be administered 3 weeks before or 3 months after immunoglobulin.

Dose:
Note National recommendations may vary.
Passive immunization in suspected diphtheria. 

IM:  
Child all ages 10 000–30 000 units in mild to moderate cases; 40 000–100 000 units in severe 
cases (for doses of more than 40 000 units, a portion should be given by intramuscular injection 
followed by the bulk of the dose intravenously after an interval of 0.5–2 hours).

Renal impairment: Dose reduction not necessary.
Hepatic impairment: Dose reduction not necessary.
Adverse effects: Common Hypersensitivity, anaphylaxis with urticaria, hypotension, dyspnoea and 

shock, serum sickness up to 12 days after injection.
Interactions with other medicines (* indicates severe):
There are no known interactions involving a significant change in effect.
Notes: All plasma fractions should comply with the WHO Requirements for the Collection, 

Processing and Quality Control of Blood, Blood Components and Plasma Derivatives (Revised 
1992). WHO Expert Committee on Biological Standardization Forty-third report, WHO 
Technical Report Series, No. 840, 1994, Annex 2.

Antitoxin will only neutralize circulating toxin that is not yet bound to tissue. If diphtheria is 
strongly suspected, treatment with diphtheria antitoxin should be given immediately after 
bacteriological specimens are taken, without waiting for laboratory results.

To eradicate diphtheria infection antibiotic therapy using an appropriate agent such as erythromycin 
or penicillin should be given in addition to diphtheria antitoxin.

Rabies immunoglobulin
ATC code: J06BB05

Injection: 150 IU/ml in vial
Special Notes: This medicine is listed as a representative of its pharmacological class. Other 

medicines in the same class may have similar clinical performance and may be selected for local 
formularies based on availability and price. The information in this monograph only applies to the 
medicine listed here.

Also referred to as RIG (rabies immune globulin) or HRIG (human rabies immune globulin).
Human and equine forms are available dependent on country. There are two forms of equine RIG; 

purified equine immunoglobulin (ERIG) and F(ab′)2.
The indication for post-exposure prophylaxis with or without RIG depends on the type of contact 

with the suspected rabid animal:
Category I: touching or feeding animals, licks on intact skin (i.e. no exposure);

WHO Model Formulary for Children 2010	 391



19	 Immunologicals
Category II: nibbling of uncovered skin, minor scratches or abrasions without bleeding, licks on 

broken skin;
Category III: single or multiple transdermal bites or scratches, contamination of mucous membrane 

with saliva from licks, exposures to bats.
For category I exposures, no prophylaxis is required; whereas for category II, immediate vaccination, 

and for category III, immediate vaccination and administration of RIG are recommended.
RIG should be administered in all category III exposures and in category II exposures involving 

immunodeficient individuals (for exposure categories, see WHO position below).
Given its relatively slow clearance (half-life about 21 days), human rabies immunoglobulin (HRIG) 

is the preferred product, particularly in cases of multiple severe exposures. However, HRIG is 
in short supply and available mainly in industrialized countries. Where HRIG is not available 
or affordable, purified equine immunoglobulin (ERIG) or F(ab′)2 products of ERIG should 
be used. Most of the new ERIG preparations are potent, highly purified, safe and considerably 
less expensive than HRIG. However, they are of heterologous origin and carry a small risk of 
hypersensitivity reactions. There are no scientific grounds for performing a skin test prior to 
administration of ERIG because testing does not predict reactions, and ERIG should be given 
whatever the result of the test.

RIG for passive immunization should not be injected later than 7 days after the initiation of 
post-exposure vaccination. The dose for HRIG is 20 units/body weight, and for ERIG and 
F(ab′)2 products 40 units/kg body weight. All of the RIG, or as much as anatomically possible 
(cave compartment syndrome), should be administered into or around the wound site(s). 
Remaining RIG if any should be injected intramuscularly at a site distant from the site of vaccine 
administration. RIG can be diluted if necessary to ensure infiltration of all wounds at a volume 
determined by the capacity of the site and sound clinical judgement.

Indications: Post-exposure (or suspected exposure) prophylaxis against rabies.
Precautions: Anaphylaxis, although rare, may occur; concomitant or recent use of live virus vaccines 

(see below).
Live virus vaccines Immunoglobulins may interfere with the immune response to live virus vaccines, 
which should be administered 3 weeks before or 3 months after immunoglobulin.

Dose:
Dose refers to human rabies immunoglobulin. Refer to Special notes for dosing of other rabies 

immunoglobulins.
Note National recommendations may vary.
Post-exposure (or suspected exposure) prophylaxis against rabies. 

Child all ages 20 units/kg single dose by infiltration in and around the cleansed wound as soon 
as possible after exposure; if wound not visible or healed or if infiltration of whole volume not 
possible, give remainder by intramuscular injection into anterolateral thigh. Give with the first 
dose of rabies vaccine.

Renal impairment: Dose reductions not necessary.
Hepatic impairment: Dose reductions not necessary.
Adverse effects: Uncommon Local reactions including pain and tenderness may occur at the site of 

intramuscular injection, systemic reactions following intravenous injection including fever, chills, 
facial flushing, headache and nausea.

Interactions with other medicines (* indicates severe):
There are no known interactions involving a significant change in effect.
Notes: For children with a small muscle mass, it may be necessary to administer immunoglobulin at 

multiple sites.

392	 WHO Model Formulary for Children 2010



19.3    Vaccines
In the case of multiple wounds in which the volume of immunoglobulin is insufficient for 

infiltration, dilution in saline solution to an adequate volume has been recommended to ensure all 
wound areas receive infiltrate.

Rabies immunoglobulin is a preparation containing immunoglobulins derived from the plasma of 
adults immunized with rabies vaccine. It is used as part of the management of potential rabies 
following exposure of an unimmunized individual to an animal in or from a high-risk country. 
It should be administered as soon as possible after exposure, without waiting for confirmation 
that the animal is rabid. The site of the bite should be washed with soapy water and the rabies 
immunoglobulin should be infiltrated in and around the site of the bite. In addition, rabies 
vaccine should be administered at a different site.

Plasma fractions should comply with the WHO Requirements for the Collection, Processing and 
Quality Control of Blood, Blood Components and Plasma Derivatives (revised 1992). WHO 
Technical Report Series No 840, 1994, Annex 2.

19.3    Vaccines
Selection of vaccines from the 2nd WHO Model List of Essential Medicines for Children for individual 
countries should be determined after consideration of international recommendations, epidemiology 
and national priorities.

Adverse effects
Vaccines are generally both effective and safe. Reactions are usually mild. Injection site reactions may 
occur and some vaccines may cause a very mild form of the disease. Serious reactions are rare. If a 
serious adverse event occurs following a dose of a vaccine, subsequent doses should not be given.
Vaccines are contraindicated in individuals with known severe hypersensitivity to any component.

HIV infection
The likelihood of successful immunization is reduced in some HIV-infected individuals, but the risk 
of serious adverse effects remains low, except for BCG (see BCG monograph). Most vaccines are safe 
in HIV-positive individuals, although live vaccines should be avoided if the CD4 count is very low. 
See under individual vaccine monographs.

Live vaccines
When two live virus vaccines are required they should either be given simultaneously at different 
sites, or with an interval of at least 4 weeks between them.

Contraindications
There are very few absolute contraindications to immunization. These include encephalopathy within 
7 days of a previous dose, anaphylaxis to a previous dose or known component, and live vaccines in 
immunocompromised individuals (see above).

WHO Model Formulary for Children 2010	 393

BCG vaccine
ATC code: J07AN01; L03AX03

Powder for injection
Special Notes: Also referred to as bacillus Calmette-Guérin.
Tuberculosis (TB) is a bacterial infection caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis, transmitted from 

person to person through respiratory contact. Where tuberculosis remains highly prevalent, 
routine immunization of infants within the first year of life with BCG vaccine, derived from 
bacillus Calmette-Guérin (an attenuated strain of Mycobacterium bovis) reduces the incidence of 
meningeal and miliary tuberculosis in early childhood. The efficacy against pulmonary tuberculosis 
is doubtful; the mainstay of the tuberculosis control programme is case-finding and treatment.

WHO recommends that all infants in highly endemic countries should receive a single dose of BCG 
vaccine as soon as possible after birth. In low-endemic countries, BCG vaccine can be given to 
infants and children at high risk of tuberculosis exposure. Infants known to be HIV-infected (with 
or without symptoms) should not receive BCG vaccination. Infants born to known HIV-infected 
mothers should only be immunized if no signs or symptoms suggestive of HIV infection are 
present and after taking into consideration the likelihood of the infant being infected with HIV, 
and the potential risk of exposure to tuberculosis. If HIV infection status can be established with 
early virological testing, BCG vaccine can be administered once HIV infection has been ruled out.

Infants exposed to smear-positive pulmonary tuberculosis shortly after birth should not receive BCG 
vaccination until completion of 6 months of prophylactic isoniazid treatment.

BCG vaccine may be given simultaneously with other live vaccines, but if not given at the same time 
they should be given 4 weeks apart. When BCG vaccine is given to infants, there is no need to 
delay routine primary immunizations.

Indications: Active immunization against tuberculosis.
Contraindications: HIV infection; immunodeficiency; patients receiving immunosuppressive 

therapy; generalized septic skin conditions; current isoniazid treatment; history of anaphylaxis to 
any component of the vaccine; pregnancy; bone marrow or lymphoid malignancy.

Precautions: Eczema or skin infection (vaccine site must be lesion-free); concomitant administration 
of other vaccines (either administer concurrently with other vaccines or separate by 4 weeks).

Dose:
Active immunization against tuberculosis. 

Intradermal:  
Neonate or Infant 0.05 ml. 
Child 0.1 ml.

Renal impairment: Dose reduction not necessary.
Hepatic impairment: Dose reduction not necessary.
Adverse effects: Common Ulcer at injection site (2–6 weeks after vaccination), enlargement of 

regional lymph nodes, transient injection site reactions (pain, redness, itching, swelling or 
burning).

Uncommon Transient fever, fainting.
Rare Abscess, keloid formation, disseminated infection, lymphadenitis, local ulceration, disseminated 

BCG infection in immunodeficient individuals, osteitis, anaphylactoid reactions.
Interactions with other medicines (* indicates severe):
	 Asparaginase: avoid use of live vaccines with asparaginase (impairment of immune response).
*	 Azathioprine: avoid use of live vaccines with azathioprine (impairment of immune response).
	 Bleomycin: avoid use of live vaccines with bleomycin (impairment of immune response).

Cholera vaccine
ATC code: J07AE01

Oral suspension
Special Notes: Two types of oral cholera vaccines are available: (i) Dukoral and (ii) Shanchol and 

mORCVAX. Shanchol and mORCVAX are identical vaccines in terms of strains but formulated 
by different manufacturers using different methods.

Dukoral is also referred to as WC-rBS.
Cholera is caused by Vibrio cholerae and is closely associated with poor sanitation. It is transmitted by 

faecal contamination of water and food; person-to-person transmission is uncommon.

WHO Model Formulary for Children 2010	 395



19	 Immunologicals
Cholera control should be a priority in areas where the disease is endemic. Given the availability of 

two oral cholera vaccines and data on their efficacy, field effectiveness, feasibility and acceptance 
in cholera-affected populations, immunization with these vaccines should be used in conjunction 
with other prevention and control strategies in areas where the disease is endemic and should be 
considered in areas at risk for outbreaks.

Vaccination should not disrupt the provision of other high-priority health interventions to control 
or prevent cholera outbreaks. Vaccines provide a short-term effect that can be implemented to 
bring about an immediate response while the longer-term interventions of improving water and 
sanitation, which involve large investments, are put into place.

Although all age groups are vulnerable to cholera, where resources are limited immunization should 
be targeted at high-risk children aged ≥ 1 year (Shanchol or mORCVAX) or ≥ 2 years (Dukoral). 
(For vaccine schedules and administration, see recommendations made by the manufacturers.)

Immunization for travellers is only recommended for individuals at increased risk of exposure, 
particularly emergency relief and health-care workers in refugee situations or individuals at 
particular risk of complications of diarrhoeal disease including those with inflammatory bowel 
disease, poorly controlled diabetes, cardiovascular disease or immune suppression.

Injectable cholera vaccine is not recommended by WHO because it provides unreliable protection 
and does not prevent transmission of infection.

Indications: Active immunization against cholera.
Contraindications: Anaphylaxis to the vaccine or any component of the vaccine.

Dose:
Dukoral (WC-rBS) 
Primary immunization against V. cholerae.  

Oral:  
Child 2–5 years three doses given > 7 days apart (but < 6 weeks apart); 
6–12 years two doses given > 7 days apart (but < 6 weeks apart).  
Note If the interval between the primary immunization doses is delayed for > 6 weeks, 
primary immunization should be restarted.

Continued risk of V. cholerae infection.  
Oral:  
Child 2–5 years one booster dose every 6 months. If the interval between the primary 
immunization series and the booster immunization is > 6 months, primary immunization must 
be repeated;  
6–12 years one booster dose after 2 years. If the interval between the primary immunization 
series and booster immunization is > 2 years, primary immunization must be repeated. 

Shanchol 
Immunization against V. cholerae.  

Oral:  
Child all ages two doses given 14 days apart. A booster dose is recommended after 2 years. 

Renal impairment: Dose reduction not necessary.
Hepatic impairment: Dose reduction not necessary.
Adverse effects: Common Abdominal discomfort, diarrhoea, headache.
Rare Allergic reactions including anaphylaxis.
Interactions with other medicines (* indicates severe):
*	 Ciclosporin: avoid use of live vaccines with ciclosporin (impairment of immune response).
*	 Dexamethasone: high doses of dexamethasone impair immune response; avoid use of live 

vaccines.

396	 WHO Model Formulary for Children 2010



19.3    Vaccines
*	 Hydrocortisone: high doses of hydrocortisone impair immune response; avoid use of live vaccines.
	 Oral typhoid vaccine: inactivated vaccine buffer may affect transit time; allow at least 8 hours 

between the administration of cholera and typhoid vaccines.
Notes: All vaccines should comply with the WHO Recommendations for Production, Control and 

Evaluation of Vaccines and Other Biological Substances; these recommendations provide guidance 
for national regulatory authorities and for vaccine manufacturers.

www.who.int/biologicals/publications/trs/areas/en/index.html
Dukoral: intake of food and drink should be avoided for 1 hour before and after vaccination.
The sodium hydrogen carbonate buffer is supplied as effervescent granules, which should be dissolved 

in a glass of water (approximately 150 ml).
Dukoral should be mixed with the sodium hydrogen carbonate solution and drunk.
Protection may be expected about 1 week after the last scheduled dose.
Dukoral has been shown to cross-protect against enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC).

Diphtheria vaccine
ATC code: J07AJ51; J07AM51

Injection: form will vary depending on other vaccines combined with diphtheria. Diphtheria 
and tetanus toxoids are adsorbed onto a mineral carrier.

Special Notes: In regards to diphtheria toxoid containing coformulations, “D” refers to the paediatric 
formulation and “d” refers to the adult formulation.

Children under 7 years should use high-dose diphtheria (“D”) vaccines.
Please be aware that formulations designed for adult immunization or booster doses in children who 

have received the full schedule of childhood vaccines may not contain as much diphtheria toxoid 
as those designed for primary immunization and may not provide adequate immunity.

In most cases, diphtheria toxoid is administered in fixed combination with other vaccines. Currently, 
diphtheria toxoid is almost exclusively available in combination with tetanus toxoid (T) as DT, or 
with tetanus and pertussis vaccine as DTP (the origin of the pertussis component often specified as 
whole cell (wP) or acellular (aP). Diphtheria toxoid may also be combined with additional vaccine 
antigens, such as hepatitis B and Haemophilus influenzae type b.

Diphtheria Diphtheria is a bacterial infection caused by Corynebacterium diphtheriae and is transmitted from 
person to person through close physical and respiratory contact. Diphtheria vaccine is a formaldehyde-inactivated 
preparation of diphtheria toxin, adsorbed onto a mineral carrier to increase its antigenicity and reduce adverse 
reactions.
Diphtheria vaccine is given as part of primary immunization schedule in fixed combinations with tetanus, 
or tetanus and pertussis vaccines. Combinations with other antigens such as Haemophilus influenzae type b, 
poliomyelitis and hepatitis B vaccines are available in some countries. Immunization against diphtheria should be 
considered for health-care workers who are at risk of occupational exposure to Corynebacterium diphtheriae.
For primary immunization in infants, a three-dose schedule of a three-component preparation of diphtheria 
vaccine in combination with pertussis and tetanus vaccines is recommended.

WHO Model Formulary for Children 2010	 397



19	 Immunologicals
A two-component diphtheria vaccine with tetanus exists in two forms. The form containing a low dose of 
diphtheria toxoid is associated with less frequent local reactions in adults and older children than the standard 
dose diphtheria preparation. Low-dose diphtheria with tetanus should be used for adults and children 7 years of 
age and older. When tetanus prophylaxis is needed following tetanus injuries, combined diphtheria and tetanus 
preparations should be used rather than tetanus alone to promote immunity against diphtheria. These lower-dose 
vaccines should not be used for primary vaccination of children under 7 as the decreased amount of diphtheria 
toxoid may not provide adequate immunity.
Indications: Active immunization against diphtheria, in addition to tetanus and/or pertussis.
Contraindications: Anaphylaxis to the vaccine or any component or the vaccine; acute febrile illness 

(defer vaccination until recovery).
Precautions: Coagulation disorders including thrombocytopenia.

Dose:
Primary immunization of children against diphtheria, tetanus and pertussis. 

IM injection:  
Infant over 6 weeks three doses each of 0.5 ml with an interval of not less than 4 weeks between 
each dose. 
Note Where resources permit, additional doses can be given after the completion of the 
primary series. In non-endemic countries, at least one booster dose should be given after 
completion of the primary series. Many national immunization programmes offer 1–2 booster 
doses, for example one at 2 years of age and a second at age 4–7 years. 
Child 1–7 years (previously unimmunized children) two doses each of 0.5 ml separated by an 
interval of 2 months, followed by a third dose after 6–12 months.

Primary immunization of children against diphtheria and tetanus. 
IM injection:  
Child 1–7 years three doses each of 0.5 ml with an interval of not less than 4 weeks between 
each dose;  
7–12 years using diphtheria (low dose) and tetanus toxoid combination (dT), two doses each of 
0.5 ml separated by an interval of 2 months, followed by a third dose after 6–12 months.

Reinforcing immunization of children against diphtheria and tetanus. 
IM injection:  
Child 1–10 years 0.5 ml at least 3 years after completion of primary course of diphtheria, 
pertussis and tetanus vaccine, or diphtheria and tetanus vaccine;  
10–12 years using diphtheria (low dose) and tetanus toxoid combination (dT), 0.5 ml 10 years 
after previous booster dose and subsequently every 10 years throughout life.

Renal impairment: Dose reduction not necessary.
Hepatic impairment: Dose reduction not necessary.
Adverse effects: Common Crying, irritability, drowsiness, restlessness, limb swelling (booster 

vaccination (fourth dose) has caused extensive swelling of the arm or thigh (usually with redness 
and pain) in approximately 2% of patients. Swelling subsides spontaneously and completely 
(usually within 2 days but may take seven)).

Uncommon Lethargy, myalgia, malaise.
Rare Urticaria, headache, peripheral neuropathy, seizures, allergic (including anaphylactoid) reactions 

occur with vaccines containing DTP, and collapse and hypotonic-hyporesponsiveness episodes 
with vaccines containing pertussis.

Interactions with other medicines (* indicates severe):
There are no known interactions where it is recommended to avoid concomitant use.

Haemophilus influenzae type b vaccine
ATC code: J07AG01; J07CA06; J07CA09; J07CA11; J07CA08; J07CA04

Injection, capsular polysaccharide of Haemophilus influenzae type b conjugated to a protein 
carrier

Special Notes: There are a number of combination products that are available (often denoted by 
abbreviations) and these vary depending on country.

Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) causes serious infection such as bacterial pneumonia and 
meningitis, especially in young children. The bacteria are transmitted from person to person 
by droplets from nasopharyngeal secretions. WHO recommends the inclusion of Haemophilus 
influenzae type b vaccine in all routine infant immunization programmes. The risk of infection 
decreases in older children and therefore Hib vaccine is not generally offered to children over 
2 years of age. However, older children and adults at an increased risk of Hib infection should be 
vaccinated, including individuals with HIV or immunoglobulin deficiency, stem cell transplant 
recipients, patients with malignant neoplasms receiving chemotherapy, and those with asplenia 
(for example, due to sickle-cell disease or splenectomy). 

For primary immunization, a three-dose series is generally given at the same time as the primary 
series of diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis vaccine. Combination preparations containing Haemophilus 
influenzae type b vaccine with either diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis, hepatitis B or poliomyelitis 
vaccines are available.

Note Risk of infection reduces rapidly in older children and the vaccine is generally not required in children 
over 10 years of age.
Indications: Active immunization against Haemophilus influenzae type b.
Contraindications: History of anaphylaxis to any component of the vaccine.
Precautions: Acute febrile illness (postpone all vaccinations until patient is well).

Dose:
Primary immunization against Haemophilus influenzae type b.  

IM:  
Infant 6 weeks–1 year three doses of 0.5 ml, each separated by 4–8 weeks (generally given at 
the same time as the primary series of diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis vaccine). A booster dose of 
0.5 ml may be given between 12 and 18 months of age. 

Not previously immunized against Haemophilus influenzae type b. 
IM:  
Child 1–10 years 0.5 ml as a single dose.

Hepatitis A vaccine
ATC code: J07BC02

Injection, inactivated hepatitis A virus
Special Notes: There are a number of combination products that are available (often denoted by 

abbreviations) and these vary depending on country.
Hepatitis A is caused by hepatitis A virus. It is transmitted via the faecal-oral route from person to 

person through close physical contact and ingestion of contaminated food and water. Those at 
increased risk of infection include parenteral drug abusers, individuals who change sexual partners 
frequently, individuals exposed to untreated sewage, those living in closed communities, travellers 
to endemic countries, laboratory staff working with the virus, patients with haemophilia treated 
with plasma-derived clotting factors, and individuals who work with primates. Patients with 
chronic liver disease including chronic hepatitis B or chronic hepatitis C are at risk of severe liver 
disease if infected with hepatitis A.

In highly endemic countries, exposure is almost universal before 10 years of age and large-scale 
immunization programmes should not be undertaken. In areas of intermediate endemicity with 
periodic outbreaks, control of hepatitis A may be achieved through widespread vaccination 
programmes, but is most successful in small, self-contained communities. In countries with low 
endemicity, vaccination for high-risk populations may be recommended.

Several vaccines are available, which provide long-lasting protection, but none are licensed for use 
in children under 1 year of age; the dose of the vaccine and vaccination schedule varies between 
manufacturers. A single dose of vaccine provides a protective antibody response within a month; 
the manufacturers recommend a second dose 6–18 months later to ensure long-term protection.

Indications: Active immunization against hepatitis A.
Contraindications: History of anaphylaxis to any component of the vaccine.
Precautions: Serious active infection; cardiovascular disease; pulmonary disorders; previous 

unexplained hepatitis or jaundice; previous hepatitis A infection; previous confirmed hepatitis A 
injection (likely to confer immunity: vaccine not needed).

Renal impairment: Dose reduction not necessary.
Hepatic impairment: Dose reduction not necessary.
Adverse effects: Common Headache, malaise, fatigue, nausea, transient injection site reactions 

(pain, redness, itching, swelling or burning, small hard lump which may persist for some weeks),

Hepatitis B vaccine
ATC code: J07BC01

Injection, inactivated hepatitis B surface antigen adsorbed onto a mineral carrier
Special Notes: Hepatitis B is caused by hepatitis B virus. It is transmitted in blood and blood 

products, by sexual contact and by contact with infectious body fluids. Persons at increased risk 
of infection because of their lifestyle, occupation or other factors include dialysis patients and 
haemophiliacs. Also at risk are babies born to mothers who are hepatitis B virus surface antigen-
positive (HbsAg-positive), those having medical or dental procedures in countries with high 
prevalence and travellers to endemic countries.

WHO recommends hepatitis B vaccine is given as part of the national infant immunization 
programme. Catch-up immunization should be considered for older age groups, or high-risk 
individuals who have not been previously immunized in countries with intermediate or low 
hepatitis B endemicity. High-risk groups may include but are not limited to: household or sexual 
contacts of known carriers, haemodialysis patients, HIV-positive, immunosuppressed, injecting 
drug users, chronic liver disease, regular blood product recipients.

Two types of hepatitis B vaccines are available: plasma-derived and recombinant vaccines. Both types 
are highly effective but the recombinant vaccine is most commonly used. Hepatitis B vaccine is 
available as a monovalent or a fixed-combination vaccine with other antigens such as Haemophilus 
influenzae type b, poliomyelitis, diphtheria, pertussis and tetanus. The monovalent vaccine should 
be used when immunizing infants at birth. Recommended schedules vary considerably between 

WHO Model Formulary for Children 2010	 401



19	 Immunologicals
countries, but the minimum recommended interval between doses is 4 weeks. In countries where 
a high proportion of hepatitis B infections are acquired perinatally, a three-dose or four-dose 
schedule is recommended with the first dose given within 24 hours of birth. The other doses are 
usually given at the same time as diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis (DTP) or other vaccines.

Also referred to as adsorbed recombinant DNA hepatitis B surface antigen.
Indications: Active immunization against hepatitis B; post-exposure prophylaxis.
Contraindications: History of anaphylaxis to any component of the vaccine.
Precautions: Acute febrile illness (postpone all vaccinations until patient is well).
A reduced immunogenicity of the vaccine may occur in individuals with immunodeficiency 

including advanced HIV infection, diabetes, chronic liver disease or chronic renal failure.

Dose:
Note The actual dose used depends on the formulation available.
Primary immunization of children against hepatitis B. 

IM:  
Neonate, Infant or Child from birth one monovalent dose at birth, then two or three 
subsequent doses of monovalent or combined hepatitis B vaccine administered according to 
schedules of national routine immunization programmes. Generally subsequent doses after 
birth dose are given at 2, 4 and 6 or 12 months of age depending on the vaccine used. 

Note Combination hepatitis B vaccines should not be used for the birth dose. This dose should be provided 
using the monovalent hepatitis B vaccine.
Alternatively if birth dose is missed (three-dose schedule).  

IM:  
Neonate, Infant or Child over 8 days three doses with 1 month duration between the first and 
second dose and the third dose to be given 5 months after the second dose (or at a minimum at 
least 2 months after the second dose).

Hepatitis B prophylaxis for infants born to hepatitis B surface antigen-positive mother. 
IM:  
Neonate one dose of vaccine with hepatitis B immunoglobulin (in the opposite thigh) within 
12 hours of birth (yet preferably immediately after birth); then three subsequent doses as per 
primary immunization (as above).

Post-exposure prophylaxis (other than at birth). 
IM:  
Child all ages administer vaccine at age appropriate dose, with the second dose given at 1 month 
and the third dose given at 2 months after the initial dose.  For those at continued risk, a fourth 
dose should be given 12 months after the first dose. 
Hepatitis B immunoglobulin should also be administered with the first dose.

Percutaneous/ ocular/ mucous membrane exposure. 
IM:  
Child all ages administer first dose of vaccine within 7 days and hepatitis B immunoglobulin 
within 72 hours.

Sexual exposure. 
IM:   
Child all ages administer first dose of vaccine and hepatitis B immunoglobulin within 14 days.

Renal impairment: Dose reduction not necessary.
Hepatic impairment: Dose reduction not necessary.
Adverse effects: Common or uncommon Transient injection site reactions (pain, redness, itching,

Influenza vaccine
ATC code: J07BB

Injection: inactivated influenza virus, types A and B
Special Notes: Influenza viruses type A and B are common causes of respiratory illnesses and are 

transmitted from person to person via droplets or respiratory secretions; their antigenic structure 
is constantly changing. WHO monitors these changes each year and makes recommendations for 
inclusion of strains in the influenza vaccines for the following season.

There are various forms of inactivated influenza vaccine available, and live vaccines are licensed 
for use in some countries. Some vaccines are grown on chick embryos and are therefore 
contraindicated in individuals hypersensitive to eggs. Split virus vaccines and subunit vaccines 
show reduced systemic reactogenicity compared with whole virus preparations.

Annual immunization with inactivated vaccine is recommended in patients of any age with diabetes 
mellitus, chronic heart disease, chronic liver disease, chronic renal disease, chronic respiratory 
disease including asthma, or immunosuppression due to disease or drug treatment. Vaccination 
with inactivated vaccine can be considered for contacts of high-risk people, children between 
6–23 months of age, health-care workers or other key workers, on the basis of national risk.

Indications: Active immunization against influenza in individuals at risk.
Contraindications: Hypersensitivity to influenza virus vaccine or any component; allergy to egg or 

egg products, chicken, chicken feathers or chicken dander; presence of acute respiratory disease or 
other active infections or illnesses (delay immunization); influenza vaccines from previous seasons 
must not be used.

Precautions: History of febrile convulsions or Guillain-Barré syndrome; children < 5 years (adverse 
effects may be more severe); acute febrile illness (postpone all vaccinations until patient is well).

Dose:
Active immunization against influenza in individuals at risk. 

IM: 
Infant or Child 6 months–3 years 0.25 ml (one or two doses); 
Child over 3 years 0.5 ml (one or two doses).

Note A second dose after at least 4 weeks is recommended in previously unvaccinated children 6 months to 
9 years of age.

19.3    Vaccines

Japanese encephalitis vaccine
ATC code: J07BA02

Injection, inactivated mouse brain-derived vaccine, or inactivated cell culture-derived vaccine, 
or live attenuated cell culture-derived SA 14-14-2 vaccine

Special Notes: Japanese encephalitis is the leading cause of viral encephalitis in Asia. It is transmitted 
to humans by mosquitoes from animal hosts (often pigs and water birds) found mostly in rural 
areas where flooding irrigation is practised. Vaccination against Japanese encephalitis should be 
considered for endemic populations where it presents a public health problem; the most effective 
strategy is an immunization catch-up campaign, followed by incorporation of the Japanese 
encephalitis vaccine into the routine immunization programme. Vaccination is also recommended 
for travellers to endemic areas.

Three types of vaccine are available: inactivated mouse brain-derived vaccine based on the Nakayama 
or Beijing strains, inactivated cell culture-derived vaccine based on the Beijing P-3 strain, and 
live attenuated cell culture-derived SA 14-14-2 vaccine; all are suitable for use in children. 
The recommended immunization schedule varies between vaccines and is dependent on local 
epidemiology; individual product information should be consulted.

Indications: Active immunization against Japanese encephalitis.
Contraindications: Anaphylaxis to the vaccine or any component of the vaccine; hypersensitivity 

to proteins of rodent or neural origin; live vaccine contraindicated in immunosuppression and 
pregnancy.

Precautions: Acute illness (postpone all vaccinations until patient is well).

Dose:
Note Formulations, doses and immunization schedules vary between products and manufacturers; consult 
product literature carefully before administration.
Active immunization against Japanese encephalitis.  

SC using inactivated mouse brain-derived vaccine:

19.3    Vaccines

Measles vaccine
ATC code: J07BD52; J07BD01

Injection (powder for solution), live, attenuated measles virus
Injection, live, attenuated measles virus, mumps virus and rubella virus

Special Notes: Measles is an acute viral infection transmitted by close respiratory contact. 
Immunization against measles is recommended for all infants and young children, and also for 
adolescents and adults who are susceptible or at high risk of exposure. Immunization should be 
considered for individuals with early signs of HIV-induced immunosuppression in endemic areas 
or during outbreaks.

To limit the impact of measles outbreaks, WHO encourages surveillance for early detection, 
thorough assessment of the risk of spread and of severe disease outcomes, and rapid responses, 
including expanded use of the measles vaccine.

Immunization of high-risk individuals within 2 days of exposure with a measles-containing vaccine 
may improve the clinical course of measles. A single dose of measles vaccine is recommended as 
part of the primary immunization programme. A second opportunity for measles immunization 
either through routine or periodic immunization services is also recommended.

Because of the risk of early and severe measles infection, HIV-infected infants (unless severely 
immunocompromised) should be given the measles vaccine at 6 months of age, followed by two 
additional doses according to the national immunization schedule (generally at 9–12 months and 
again before 6 years).

The measles vaccine is a live, attenuated vaccine, available either as a single-antigen vaccine or 
combined with either rubella (MR), or mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccines; the combined 
vaccines are usually given as part of the primary immunization schedule.

Multiple international studies have found no evidence for an alleged association between measles 
or MMR immunization and serious developmental disorders including autism, or chronic bowel 
disease.

Indications: Active immunization against measles.
Contraindications: Pregnancy (pregnancy should be avoided for 28 days after vaccination with MMR 

due to the theoretical risk of transmission of the rubella component of the vaccine to a susceptible 
fetus); immunosuppression (measles as a live vaccine is contraindicated in congenital or acquired 
impaired immunity. An exception is HIV-positive individuals where MMR may be given unless 
they have advanced AIDS with severely impaired immunity).

Precautions: Acute illness (postpone all vaccinations until patient is well); treatment with 
immunoglobulins or whole blood normal immunoglobulin (see note below); whole blood 
transfusion (see note below).

Whole blood transfusion Whole blood transfusion may reduce antibody response to vaccine; test for 
antibodies after 8 weeks; revaccinate if necessary.
Immunoglobulins Treatment with immunoglobulins or whole blood normal immunoglobulin may 
interfere with the immune response to some live virus vaccines. Do not give rubella vaccine for 3 months after IM 
immunoglobulin or 9 months after IV immunoglobulin. 

Dose:
Primary immunization of children against measles. 

IM or SC: 
Infant 9–12 months 0.5 ml dose. A second dose of 0.5 ml is recommended for patients up to 
6 years of age, but not within 4 weeks of the first dose.

Meningococcal meningitis vaccine
ATC code: J07AH

Injection: capsular polysaccharide antigen of Neisseria meningitidis serogroup C conjugated to 
a protein carrier and adsorbed onto a mineral carrier; and the same for serogroups A and C or 
groups A, C, W135 and Y

Special Notes: N. meningitidis causes meningococcal disease including meningitis and septicaemia 
and primarily affects young children. The bacteria are transmitted from person to person via 
respiratory secretions. Immunization against meningococcal disease is recommended as part of 
the routine childhood immunization programme, for outbreak situations, for individuals at high 
risk including those in military camps and boarding schools, travellers to endemic areas, and for 
those with a predisposition to meningococcal disease (such as asplenia and inherited immune 
deficiencies).

Meningococcal vaccines are available as combinations of capsular polysaccharide antigens (serogroups 
A and C, or A, C, W135 and Y) or as a polysaccharide of serogroup C conjugated to a protein 
carrier. There is also a polysaccharide of serogroups A, C, Y and W135 conjugated to a protein 
carrier. Other variants of the vaccine are available in some countries.

Group C conjugate vaccine is recommended for national childhood immunization programmes; for 
children 2–12 months of age, three doses are given at intervals of 4 weeks. A booster at 12 months 
is recommended.

A single dose of group C conjugate vaccine is sufficient in children over 12 months of age. However, 
individuals with asplenia or splenic dysfunction should be given two doses each 2 months apart; 
immunized individuals who develop splenic dysfunction should be given one additional dose.

A single dose of either A and C, or A, C, W135 and Y polysaccharide vaccine is recommended to 
control outbreaks and for at-risk individuals including travellers to endemic areas. Groups A and 
C, and A, C, W135 and Y unconjugated vaccines elicit a suboptimal response in infants under 
2 years of age and are not recommended for routine immunization; however, they may be given in 
emergency outbreak situations.

Meningococcal C conjugate vaccines also known as MenCCV.
Meningococcal polysaccharide vaccines (groups A, C, Y and W135) also known as 4vMenPV.
Meningococcal conjugate vaccine (groups A, C, Y and W135) also known as MCV4.
Indications: Active immunization against meningitis and septicaemia caused by Neisseria meningitidis 

serogroup C, serogroups A and C, or serogroups A, C, W135 and Y.
Contraindications: History of anaphylaxis to any component of the vaccine.
Precautions: Acute illness: postpone all vaccinations until patient is well.

Mumps vaccine
ATC code: J07BD52; J07BE01

Injection (powder for solution), live attenuated strain of mumps virus
Special Notes: Mumps is a mostly mild childhood disease, but it can also affect adults, in whom 

complications such as meningitis and orchitis are more common. The mumps virus is transmitted 
from person to person via airborne droplets. Mumps vaccine is a live, attenuated vaccine and is 
available as a single-antigen vaccine or in combination with measles and rubella vaccines. For 
countries seeking to immunize against mumps, WHO recommends the use of the combined 
measles, mumps and rubella vaccine (MMR) as part of the national infant immunization 
programme. Two doses of mumps vaccine are required for long-term protection; the first dose 
should be given at 12–18 months of age; the second dose at least 4 weeks later up to 6 years of age 
(usually school entry age).

Indications: Active immunization against mumps.

410	 WHO Model Formulary for Children 2010



19.3    Vaccines
Contraindications: Immunosuppression (mumps as a live vaccine is contraindicated in congenital 

or acquired impaired immunity. An exception is HIV-positive individuals where measles, mumps,

Pertussis vaccine
ATC code: J07AJ51; J07AJ02; J07AJ01

Injection, acellular or whole cell vaccine usually combined with diphtheria and tetanus toxoids
Special Notes: Two types of pertussis vaccine are available, acellular pertussis (aP) and whole-cell 

pertussis (wP).
Pertussis (whooping cough) is a bacterial respiratory infection caused by Bordetella pertussis and is 

transmitted through droplets. Pertussis vaccine is usually administered in fixed-dose combinations 
with diphtheria, tetanus and other vaccines as part of the primary immunization programme. 
WHO recommends three doses, each to be given at 6, 10 and 14 weeks of age. Booster doses 
are recommended 1–6 years after the primary series in countries where the incidence of pertussis 
has been reduced by immunization. Single component pertussis vaccines are available in some 
countries.

Whole-cell vaccine composed is frequently associated with minor adverse reactions such as local 
redness and swelling, fever and agitation. Prolonged crying and seizures are less common. Local 
administration site reactions tend to increase with age and number of injections and so whole-cell 
pertussis vaccine is not recommended for adolescents and adults. An acellular form of the vaccine 
is also available and can be used for immunization of older children and adults; it has fewer local 
and systemic effects compared with whole-cell pertussis vaccine (see under Diphtheria).

Indications: Active immunization against pertussis.
Contraindications: Anaphylaxis to vaccine or any component of the vaccine.
Precautions: Acute illness (postpone all vaccinations until patient is well).

Booster doses are recommended 1–6 years after the primary series in countries where 
the incidence of pertussis has been reduced by immunization. Some countries are now 
recommending a booster dose in adolescence or early adulthood due to waning immunity of the 
vaccine in childhood.

Renal impairment: Dose reduction not necessary.
Hepatic impairment: Dose reduction not necessary.
Adverse effects: Side-effects are less common with the use of the acellular vaccine than they are with 

the whole-cell vaccine.

Pneumococcal vaccine
ATC code: J07AL02

Injection, capsular polysaccharides of Streptococcus pneumoniae conjugated to a protein  
carrier, adsorbed onto a mineral carrier

Special Notes: There are three variants of the conjugated vaccine:
7-valent conjugate vaccine known as PCV-7 or 7vPCV;
10-valent conjugate vaccine known as PCV-10 or 10vPCV;
13-valent conjugate vaccine known as PCV-13 or 13vPCV.
There is also a 23-valent unconjugated pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine known as 23vPPV.
Streptococcus pneumoniae causes serious infection such as pneumonia and meningitis, especially 

in young children under 2 years of age, the elderly and individuals with immunodeficiency. 
The bacteria are transmitted via respiratory secretions. WHO recommends that pneumococcal 
conjugate vaccine should be included in national routine childhood immunization programmes. 
The 7-valent conjugate vaccine (PCV-7) provides effective protection in young children; the 
primary schedule usually consists of three doses, each administered at intervals of at least 4 weeks; 

WHO Model Formulary for Children 2010	 413



19	 Immunologicals
other three-dose schedules have been shown to be effective and are in use in some countries. A 
booster dose given after 12 months of age may improve the immune response. Immunization 
should be initiated before 6 months of age and may start as early as 6 weeks of age. The vaccine can 
be given to HIV-infected individuals.

A single dose of PCV-7 can be given to children aged 12–24 months of age who have not been 
previously vaccinated and children 2–5 years of age at high risk of pneumococcal disease.

A 23-valent (unconjugated) polysaccharide vaccine is also available for adults and children over 
2 years of age at risk of pneumococcal infection (it provides a suboptimal response in infants).

Indications: Active immunization against Streptococcus pneumoniae.
Contraindications: History of anaphylaxis to any component of the vaccine.
Precautions: Acute febrile illness: postpone all vaccinations until patient is well.
23-valent (unconjugated) polysaccharide vaccine is not recommended for children under 2 years.

Dose:
Primary immunization against Streptococcus pneumoniae. 

IM injection using pneumococcal polysaccharide conjugated vaccine (7vPCV):

19.3    Vaccines

Poliomyelitis vaccine
ATC code: J07BF01; J07BF02; J07BF03

Oral suspension, live, attenuated poliomyelitis virus, types 1, 2 and 3
Injection, inactivated poliomyelitis virus, types 1, 2 and 3

Special Notes: Poliomyelitis is an acute viral infection, which causes paralysis of varying degrees. It 
is transmitted from person to person via the oral-oral or faecal-oral route. Poliomyelitis vaccine 
should be included in national routine childhood immunization programmes.

There are two types of vaccines. Oral poliomyelitis vaccine (OPV) contains three types of live 
attenuated poliomyelitis viruses; monovalent live oral vaccines are also available. Injectable 
inactivated poliomyelitis vaccine (IPV) contains three types of inactivated strains.

For primary immunization using oral poliomyelitis vaccine, a three-dose schedule is used. The 
vaccine may need to be repeated in patients with diarrhoea or vomiting. HIV-infected individuals 
can receive the live oral vaccine, but it must not be used for those with primary immunodeficiency, 
those who are immunosuppressed or their close contacts. The need for strict personal hygiene must 
be stressed as the vaccine virus is excreted in the faeces; the contacts of a recently vaccinated baby 
should be advised of the need to wash their hands after changing the baby’s nappies. Reinforcing 
doses can be given after primary immunization.

Inactivated poliomyelitis vaccine is used in some countries for routine immunization; routine 
schedules vary widely, but in industrialized countries usually include 2–3 doses in the first year of 
life and at least one booster dose 6–12 months after the last dose of the primary series. Sequential 
schedules using IPV followed by OPV are also used in some countries to decrease the risk of 
vaccine-associated poliomyelitis, which occurs rarely with OPV; usually 1–3 doses of IPV are 
followed by 2–3 doses of OPV. The inactivated vaccine is available as a monovalent vaccine or in 
fixed combinations with other antigens.

Countries considering a change from OPV to IPV use should conduct a thorough evaluation of the 
epidemiological, financial and operational implications before finalizing a change in policy.

Indications: Active immunization against poliomyelitis.
Contraindications: Anaphylaxis to previous dose of the vaccine or following any component of the 

vaccine; primary immunodeficiency or immunosuppressed patients or their close contacts (avoid 
live oral vaccine).

Precautions: HIV-infected individuals (may receive the live oral vaccine); stringent hand-washing 
required (oral polio vaccine may be excreted in the stools). 

Dose:
Primary immunization of children against poliomyelitis. 

Oral: 
Neonate or Infant 3 drops at birth and 3 drops at 6, 10 and 14 weeks of age.  
IM: 
Child three doses of 0.5 ml, each separated by at least 4 weeks (e.g. at 6, 10 and 14 weeks of age 
or at 2, 4 and 6 months of age).

Reinforcing immunization of children against poliomyelitis. 
Oral: 
Child 3 drops at least 3 years after completion of primary course and a further 3 drops at 
15–19 years of age.  
IM: 
Infant or Child 0.5 ml 6–12 months after primary immunization. Further reinforcing doses are 
given in some countries (e.g. at 4–6 years; consult national schedule).

19.3    Vaccines

Rabies vaccine
ATC code: J07BG01

Injection, inactivated rabies virus prepared in cell culture
Special Notes: Rabies is a virus transmitted to humans by rabid animals via a bite or scratch. It is 

invariably fatal once signs of disease occur. WHO recommends pre-exposure immunization of 
individuals at increased risk of contracting rabies either due to occupational exposure such as 
laboratory workers, veterinary surgeons, animal handlers and health workers or people living 
or travelling to enzootic areas; in such areas children aged 5–15 years are at particular risk of 
exposure. Cell-derived vaccines are used for both pre-exposure and post-exposure protection. 
Vaccines of nerve cell tissue origin should not be used because they are less potent and are 
frequently associated with adverse events.

Rabies vaccine is used as part of the post-exposure treatment to prevent rabies in patients who have 
been bitten by rabid animals or animals suspected of being rabid. The bite wound or scratch 
should be thoroughly cleansed. Treatment is dependent upon the individual’s immune status 
and upon the level of risk of rabies in the country concerned (consult national immunization 
schedule).

In certain circumstances, such as patients with incomplete prophylaxis or unimmunized individuals, 
passive immunization with rabies immunoglobulin can be given (see rabies immunoglobulin, 
section 19.2). Rabies has occurred in people who have received post-exposure rabies vaccine 
without rabies immunoglobulin being infiltrated in and around the wound. Therefore, post-
exposure treatment, in those who have not completed pre-exposure prophylaxis, should include 
infiltration of human rabies immunogobulin (HRIG) in and around wound(s) at the same time as 
the first dose of the rabies vaccine.

Post-exposure treatment with rabies vaccine and rabies immunoglobulin is necessary for individuals 
who are immunocompromised, HIV-positive, taking malaria chemoprophylaxis or under 
anaesthesia; antibody response should be monitored.

Indications: Pre-exposure immunization against rabies; post-exposure prophylaxis against rabies.
Contraindications: There are no contraindications to post-exposure prophylaxis following high-

risk exposure. For pre-exposure immunization, previous severe reaction to any of the vaccine 
components is a contraindication to further use of the same vaccine.

Precautions: Concomitant chloroquine use (reduced response to intradermal route; use IM route); 
concomitant rabies immunoglobulin (administer using different sites and different syringes). 

Dose:
Pre-exposure immunization against rabies. 

IM:  
Child all ages 1 ml on days 0, 7 and 28 (day 28 preferable, but administration may be advanced 
towards day 21 if time is limited). 
Intradermal:   
Child all ages 0.1 ml on days 0, 7 and 28 (administration may be advanced towards day 21 if 
time is limited).

Booster doses Periodic booster doses are recommended only for individuals whose environment 
puts them at continuous or frequent risk of rabies exposure. In such cases, a booster dose should be given 
at intervals dictated by regular testing for rabies antibodies (virus neutralizing antibodies of at least 0.5 IU/
ml indicate protection). Where serological testing is unavailable, booster vaccination every 5 years may be an 
acceptable alternative.

WHO Model Formulary for Children 2010	 417

Post-exposure prophylaxis against rabies in unimmunized individuals.  
IM:  
Child all ages 1 ml on days 0, 3, 7, 14 and 28 (five-dose regimen). Alternatively, a four-dose 
regimen may be used with two doses of 1 ml on day 0 (one in each of the two deltoid or thigh 
regions) followed by one dose each on days 7 and 21.  
Intradermal:  
Child all ages (eight-site regimen) 0.1 ml administered at eight separate sites on day 0 (one in 
each upper arm, one in each lateral thigh, one on each side of the suprascapular region, and 
one on each side of the lower quadrant region of the abdomen); on day 7, 0.1 ml in each upper 
arm and each lateral thigh; on days 30 and 90, 0.1 ml in one upper arm. The one dose on day 
90 may be replaced by two intradermal injections on day 30.  
Alternatively (two-site regimen) 0.1 ml at two sites on days 0, 3, 7 and 28.

Post-exposure treatment against rabies in fully immunized individuals.  
IM or intradermal:  
Child all ages two doses (1 ml IM or 0.1 ml intradermal) on days 0 and 3.

Renal impairment: Dose reduction not necessary.
Hepatic impairment: Dose reduction not necessary.
Adverse effects: Common Headache, dizziness, malaise, myalgia, nausea, serum sickness-like reaction 

(after booster dose), weakness, rash, transient injection site reactions (pain, redness, itching, 
swelling or burning, small hard lump which may persist for some weeks), transient fever, fainting, 
mild gastrointestinal disturbances.

Uncommon Angioedema.
Rare Neuroparalytic events, allergic reactions including anaphylaxis.
Interactions with other medicines (* indicates severe):
There are no known interactions where it is recommended to avoid concomitant use.
Notes: WHO recommends the intradermal route of administration for rabies pre- and post-exposure 

prophylaxis. Refer to manufacturer literature for product specific advice.
Intradermal administration is technically more demanding and requires appropriate staff training and 

qualified supervision.
All vaccines should comply with the WHO Recommendations for Production, Control and 

Evaluation of Vaccines and Other Biological Substances; these recommendations provide guidance 
for national regulatory authorities and for vaccine manufacturers.

19.3    Vaccines

Rotavirus vaccine
ATC code: J07BH01; J07BH02

Oral suspension, live, attenuated rotavirus
Special Notes: Two oral, live, attenuated rotavirus vaccines, Rotarix® and RotaTeq®, are available 

internationally; both vaccines are considered safe and effective in preventing gastrointestinal 
disease caused by rotaviruses.

The dose, schedule and preparation varies between products. Ensure correct product is selected.
Rotaviruses are the most common cause of severe diarrhoea in infants and young children. The virus 

is transmitted via the faecal-oral route from person to person in close contact or via contaminated 
fomites.

WHO recommends that rotavirus vaccine for infants should be included in all national 
immunization programmes. In countries where diarrhoeal deaths account for ≥ 10% of mortality 
among children aged < 5 years, the introduction of the vaccine is strongly recommended.

Taking into account new evidence, WHO now recommends that infants worldwide be vaccinated 
against rotavirus.

Indications: Active immunization against rotavirus infection.
Contraindications: Anaphylaxis to previous dose of rotavirus vaccine or vaccine component.
Precautions: Diarrhoea or vomiting (postpone immunization); immunosuppressed close contacts 

(see note below); acute illness (postpone immunization); history of intussusception.
Immunosuppressed contacts The rotavirus vaccine virus is excreted in the faeces and may be 
transmitted to close contacts; the vaccine should be used with caution in those with immunosuppressed close 
contacts. Carers should be advised of the need for careful hand-washing techniques. 

Dose:
Immunization of infants against rotavirus infection. 

Oral using Rotarix®: 
Infant 6–24 weeks two-dose schedule, 1 ml dose given at 2 and 4 months of age. 
Note Initial dose should be administered from 6 weeks through 14 weeks and 6 days of age; 
the first and second dose should be separated by at least 4 weeks. The two-dose schedule should 
be completed by 24 weeks of age. 
Oral using RotaTeq®:  
Infant 6–32 weeks three-dose schedule, 2 ml dose given at 2, 4 and 6 months of age. 
Note Initial dose should be administered from 6 weeks through 14 weeks and 6 days of age; 
the doses should be separated by at least 4 weeks. The three-dose schedule should be completed 
by 8 months (32 weeks) of age.

Renal impairment: Dose reduction not necessary.
Hepatic impairment: Dose reduction not necessary.
Adverse effects: Common Irritability, loss of appetite, diarrhoea, vomiting.
Rare Allergic reactions including anaphylaxis.
Interactions with other medicines (* indicates severe):

19.3    Vaccines

Rubella vaccine
ATC code: J07BJ01; J07BD52; J07BD53

Injection (powder for solution for injection), live attenuated rubella virus
Special Notes: Rubella is normally a mild childhood disease, which is transmitted from person to 

person via the respiratory route. The primary purpose of rubella vaccination is to prevent rubella 
infection during pregnancy, which can lead to fetal death and congenital rubella syndrome 
(characterized by multiple birth defects including mental retardation, hearing and visual 
impairment). WHO recommends either universal immunization of infants and children through 
the national immunization programme to eliminate rubella and congenital rubella syndrome, or 
prevention of congenital rubella syndrome through immunization of women of childbearing age. 
Countries seeking to eliminate rubella should ensure that women of childbearing age and over 
80% of children are immunized.

There are a number of rubella vaccines available, either as single antigen vaccines or combined with 
measles and mumps vaccine (MMR), or measles vaccine (MR). In most countries, the vaccine 
is given as MMR or MR as part of the childhood immunization programme. Most vaccines are 
based on the live, attenuated RA 27/3 strain of rubella virus. Rubella vaccine is usually given to 
infants together with measles vaccine (see MMR vaccine).

Indications: Active immunization against rubella.
Contraindications: Untreated active tuberculosis; pregnancy (avoid pregnancy for 28 days after 

vaccination with rubella vaccine or MMR due to the theoretical risk of transmission of the rubella 
component of the vaccine to a susceptible fetus); history of anaphylaxis to any component of the 
vaccine; advanced immunodeficiency (asymptomatic HIV-positive patients may be given rubella 
vaccine).

Precautions: Acute illness (postpone all vaccinations until patient is well); treatment with 
immunoglobulins or whole blood normal immunoglobulin (see note below); whole blood 
transfusion (see note below).

Whole blood transfusion Whole blood transfusion may reduce antibody response to vaccine; test for 
antibodies after 8 weeks; revaccinate if necessary.
Immunoglobulins Treatment with immunoglobulins or whole blood normal immunoglobulin may 
interfere with the immune response to some live virus vaccines. Do not give rubella vaccine for 3 months after IM 
immunoglobulin or 9 months after IV immunoglobulin.

Dose:
Immunization against rubella. 

SC:  
Child all ages 0.5 ml as a single dose.

See measles vaccine for combined measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) doses.
Renal impairment: Dose reduction not necessary.
Hepatic impairment: Dose reduction not necessary.
Adverse effects: Common Sore throat, lymphadenopathy, rash.
Uncommon Arthritis, arthralgia.
Rare Chronic joint symptoms, thrombocytopenia.

Tetanus vaccine
ATC code: J07AJ52; J07AJ51; J07AM51

Injection, tetanus toxoid adsorbed onto a mineral carrier
Special Notes: Tetanus toxoid vaccines are available as single toxoid (TT), combined with diphtheria 

toxoid (DT) or low-dose diphtheria toxoid (dT) and in combination with diphtheria and pertussis 
vaccines (DTwP, DTaP, dTaP or dTaP). Vaccines containing DT are used for children aged under 
7 years and dT-containing vaccines for individuals aged 7 years and over. Tetanus toxoid is also 
available in combination with vaccines against hepatitis B, Haemophilus influenzae type b and 
poliomyelitis.

As a rule, vaccine combinations containing diphtheria toxoid (D or d) and tetanus toxoid, rather 
than tetanus toxoid alone, should be used when immunization against tetanus is indicated.

422	 WHO Model Formulary for Children 2010



19.3    Vaccines
Tetanus is caused by the action of a neurotoxin of Clostridium tetani in necrosed tissues such as occur 

in dirty wounds. Tetanus vaccines are based on tetanus toxoid, which is adsorbed on aluminium or 
calcium salts to increase immunogenicity. Tetanus toxoid is available both as single antigen and in 
vaccine combinations.

Neonatal tetanus due to infection of the baby’s umbilical stump during unclean delivery is the cause 
of many deaths of newborn infants. Control of neonatal tetanus may be achieved by ensuring 
adequate hygiene during delivery and by ensuring protective immunity of mothers in late 
pregnancy. Alternatively, women of childbearing age may be immunized.

For clean wounds, fully immunized individuals (those who have received a total of five doses of 
tetanus vaccine at appropriate intervals) and those whose primary immunization is complete (with 
boosters up to date) do not require tetanus vaccine; individuals whose primary immunization 
is incomplete or whose boosters are not up to date require a reinforcing dose of tetanus vaccine 
(followed by further doses as required to complete the schedule); non-immunized individuals 
(or those whose immunization status is not known or who have been immunized but are now 
immunocompromised) should be given a dose of the vaccine immediately (followed by completion 
of the full course of the vaccine if records confirm the need).

Wounds are considered to be tetanus-prone if they are sustained either more than 6 hours before 
surgical treatment of the wound or at any interval after injury and show one or more of the 
following: a puncture-type wound, a compound fracture, a wound containing foreign bodies, a 
significant degree of devitalized tissue, clinical evidence of sepsis, contamination with soil/manure 
likely to contain tetanus organisms. All wounds should receive thorough cleansing. Antibacterial 
prophylaxis may also be required for tetanus-prone wounds. For tetanus-prone wounds, 
management is as for clean wounds with the addition of a dose of antitetanus immunoglobulin 
(section 19.2) given at a different site; in fully immunized individuals and those whose primary 
immunization is complete (see above) the immunoglobulin is needed only if the risk of infection 
is especially high (for example, contamination with manure). Antibacterial prophylaxis (with 
benzylpenicillin, or amoxicillin with clavulanic acid, or metronidazole) may also be required for 
tetanus-prone wounds.

Indications: Active immunization against tetanus; wound management (tetanus-prone wounds and 
clean wounds).

Contraindications: Hypersensitivity to tetanus toxoid or any component of the vaccine.
Precautions: Acute febrile illness (postpone immunization, unless a tetanus-prone wound). 

Dose:
WHO recommends a childhood tetanus immunization schedule of five doses; the primary series 

of three doses should be given during the first year of life as combined diphtheria, tetanus and 
pertussis vaccine (DTP). The fourth booster dose with a tetanus toxoid-containing vaccine 
should be given at 4–7 years and the fifth dose during adolescence at 12–15 years. A sixth dose 
can be given in early adulthood for lifelong protection. When tetanus prophylaxis is needed 
following tetanus injuries, combined diphtheria and tetanus preparations should be used rather 
than tetanus alone to promote immunity against diphtheria.

Renal impairment: No dose reduction necessary.
Hepatic impairment: No dose reduction necessary.
Adverse effects: Common or uncommon Lethargy, myalgia, transient injection site reactions (pain, 

redness, itching, swelling or burning, small hard lump which may persist for some weeks), 
transient fever, fainting.

Rare Urticaria, malaise, headache, peripheral neuropathy, allergic reactions including anaphylaxis.

Typhoid vaccine
ATC code: J07AP01; J07AP03

Capsules or suspension, live attenuated strain of Salmonella typhi (Ty21a) 
Injection, Vi capsular polysaccharide typhoid 25 micrograms/0.5 ml

Special Notes: Typhoid fever is caused by Salmonella typhi. It is transmitted via the faecal-oral 
route and associated with poor hygiene and sanitation. Immunization against typhoid fever is 
recommended for children of school age and adults in endemic areas, travellers to endemic areas 
and laboratory workers handling specimens from suspected cases. The vaccines do not provide 
complete protection and should not replace hygiene precautions.

A single dose of parenteral Vi capsular polysaccharide vaccine is recommended for adults and 
children over 2 years of age, followed by booster doses every 3 years on continued exposure.

A live oral typhoid vaccine containing an attenuated strain of S. typhi (Ty21a) is available either as 
enteric-coated capsules, or as a liquid suspension. The capsules are licensed for individuals over 
5 years of age and are given as four doses, each 2 days apart; the suspension can be administered 
to children over 2 years of age and is given as three doses, each 2 days apart. Protection is achieved 
7 days after the last dose. In endemic areas, a booster dose of the live oral vaccine is recommended 
every 3 years; for travellers to endemic areas from non-endemic areas, an annual booster is 
recommended.

Inactivated whole cell typhoid vaccines may still be available in some countries; children over 5 years 
of age are given two doses separated by an interval of 4 weeks, with a booster dose every 3 years. 
However, inactivated whole cell vaccines are associated with frequent adverse effects and WHO 
recommends that these vaccines should be replaced with either the Vi-based polysaccharide 
vaccine or live oral vaccines.

Indications: Active immunization against typhoid.
Contraindications: Anaphylaxis following previous typhoid vaccine or history of anaphylaxis to one 

of the vaccine components; acute gastrointestinal illness (oral vaccine).
Precautions: Acute illness (postpone vaccination until well); HIV-positive patients (see below); 

immunosuppressed patients (see below); treatment with anti-infectives active against S. typhi (see 
below).

HIV and immunosuppressed patients Asymptomatic HIV-positive individuals can be given the 
vaccine if CD4 counts are over 200 cells/mm3. It is recommended to use the Vi-based polysaccharide parenteral 
vaccine rather than the oral vaccine in individuals with impaired immunity.
Antibacterials Oral typhoid vaccine is inactivated by concomitant administration of antibacterials; if 
possible, antibacterials should be avoided 3 days before and 3 days after.

Varicella vaccine
ATC code: J07BK01

Injection, live, attenuated varicella-zoster virus
Special Notes: Varicella-zoster (chickenpox) is a highly contagious disease caused by varicella-zoster 

virus. Transmission is via droplets, aerosol or direct person to person contact. Various formulations 
of the live attenuated vaccine based on the Okastrain are available. Varicella-zoster vaccine may be 
used as part of a national childhood immunization programme. The vaccine may also be used in 
adolescents or adults without a history of varicella and who are at increased risk of infection.

A single dose of vaccine is effective in children aged 1–12 years (the optimal age is 12–24 months).  
Rarely, the varicella-zoster vaccine virus has been transmitted from vaccinated individuals to close 

contacts; if a vaccine-related rash develops within 4–6 weeks, contact with varicella-susceptible 
pregnant women and individuals at high risk of severe varicella infection, including patients with 
immunodeficiency or receiving immunosuppressive therapy, should be avoided.

Indications: Active immunization against varicella-zoster.
Contraindications: Pregnancy (avoid pregnancy for 3 months after vaccination); immunodeficiency; 

patients receiving immunosuppressive therapy; untreated active tuberculosis; history of anaphylaxis 
to any component of the vaccine.

Precautions: Acute illness (postpone all vaccinations until patient is well); treatment with 
immunoglobulins or whole blood normal immunoglobulin (see below); whole blood transfusion 
(see below); family history of congenital immune disorders; post-vaccination close contact with 
susceptible individuals. 

Whole blood transfusion Whole blood transfusion may reduce antibody response to vaccine; test for 
antibodies after 8 weeks; revaccinate if necessary. 
Immunoglobulins Treatment with immunoglobulins or whole blood normal immunoglobulin may 
interfere with the immune response to some live virus vaccines. Do not give varicella-zoster vaccines for 3 months 
after IM immunoglobulin or 9 months after IV immunoglobulin. 

Dose:
Immunization against varicella infection. 

SC:  
Child 1–12 years 0.5 ml as a single dose.

Renal impairment: Dose reduction not required.
Hepatic impairment: Dose reduction not required.

Yellow fever vaccine
ATC code: J07BL01

Powder for injection live, attenuated yellow fever virus
Special Notes: Also referred to as yellow fever 17D.
Yellow fever is a viral haemorrhagic fever endemic in tropical regions of Africa and South America. 

The disease is transmitted by Haemagogus and Aedes mosquito bites. Yellow fever 17D vaccine is a 
live attenuated vaccine, which offers protection from 10 days after vaccination, for at least 10 years.

WHO recommends that all countries with endemic yellow fever should incorporate yellow fever 
vaccine into their national immunization programme; the vaccine should be given to infants 
9–12 months of age and can be given at the same time as the measles vaccine. Yellow fever vaccine 
is also recommended for people at high risk of yellow fever exposure, people living in or travelling 
to endemic areas. During epidemics, mass vaccination campaigns should be initiated as early as 
possible.

Immunization is not recommended for infants 6–8 months of age or during pregnancy, except 
during an epidemic when the risk of transmission may be very high. Yellow fever vaccine is 
contraindicated in individuals with severe immunodeficiency or severe egg allergy (HIV-infected 
individuals may be vaccinated if CD4 cell counts are over 200 cells/mm3).

Indications: Active immunization against yellow fever.
Contraindications: Hypersensitivity to the vaccine, egg or chick embryo protein, or any component; 

immunosuppressed patients; children less than 6 months of age.
Precautions: Patients with thymic disorders including myasthenia gravis, thymoma or prior 

thymectomy; concomitant administration of other live vaccines.

Dose:
Active immunization against yellow fever. 

Deep SC or IM:  
Child over 9 months 0.5 ml single dose. Repeat same dosage every 10 years if at continued risk 
of exposure.

Note Dose should be given at least 10 days before travel to yellow fever endemic area.
Renal impairment: Dose reduction not required.
Hepatic impairment: Dose reduction not required.
Adverse effects: Common Headache, myalgia, weakness, nausea, diarrhoea.
Uncommon Abdominal pain, vomiting, malaise, influenza-like symptoms, arthralgia.

SECTION 20:
Muscle relaxants (peripherally-acting) and cholinesterase 
inhibitors

430	 WHO Model Formulary for Children 2010



20      Muscle relaxants (peripherally-acting) and cholinesterase inhibitors

20	 Muscle relaxants (peripherally-acting) and 
cholinesterase inhibitors

Muscle relaxants
Muscle relaxants used in surgery are classified, according to their mode of action, as either depolarizing 
or non-depolarizing neuromuscular blocking drugs. Their use allows abdominal surgery to be carried 
out under light anaesthesia. They should never be given until it is certain that general anaesthesia 
has been established, and ventilation must be mechanically assisted until they have been completely 
inactivated.

Cholinesterase inhibitors
Reversal of block
Cholinesterase inhibitors, such as neostigmine, are used at the end of surgery as the preferred agent 
to reverse the muscle paralysis produced by non-depolarizing blocking drugs such as vecuronium. 
Neostigmine must NOT be used with depolarizing blocking drugs such as suxamethonium, since 
neostigmine will prolong the muscle paralysis.

Myasthenia gravis
Cholinesterase inhibitors such as neostigmine and pyridostigmine are also used in the symptomatic
treatment of myasthenia gravis. They enhance neuromuscular transmission by inhibiting 
acetylcholinesterase, thereby prolonging the action of acetylcholine. This produces at least a partial 
improvement in most myasthenic patients, but complete restoration of muscle strength is rare.
In a myasthenic crisis, if the patient has difficulty in breathing and in swallowing, cholinesterase 
inhibitors must be given by intramuscular or subcutaneous injection. 

Neostigmine
ATC code: N07AA01

Injection: 500 micrograms in 1 ml ampoule; 2.5 mg (metilsulfate) in 1 ml ampoule
Tablet: 15 mg (bromide)

Indications: Treatment of myasthenia gravis; reversal of non-depolarizing muscle block. 
Contraindications: Recent intestinal or bladder surgery; mechanical intestinal or urinary tract 

obstruction; after suxamethonium; pneumonia; peritonitis.
Precautions: Asthma; urinary tract infection; cardiovascular disease including arrhythmias, 

bradycardia, vagotonia, recent myocardial infarction or atrioventricular block; hyperthyroidism; 
hypotension; peptic ulcer; epilepsy; renal impairment.

Dose:
Treatment of myasthenia gravis (using neostigmine bromide).  

Oral:  
Neonate initially 1–2 mg, then 1–5 mg every 4 hours, 30 minutes before feeds.  
Infant or Child less than 6 years initially 7.5 mg, repeated at suitable intervals throughout the 
day. Total daily dose usually 15–90 mg;  
6–12 years initially 15 mg, repeated at suitable intervals throughout the day. Total daily dose 
usually 15–90 mg.

WHO Model Formulary for Children 2010	 431



20	 Muscle relaxants (peripherally-acting) and cholinesterase inhibitors

Treatment of myasthenia gravis (using neostigmine metilsulfate).  
SC or IM:   
Neonate 150 micrograms/kg every 6–8 hours, 30 minutes before feeds, increased to a maximum 
of 300 micrograms/kg every 4 hours, if necessary.  
Infant or Child 200–500 micrograms repeated at suitable intervals throughout the day.

Reversal of non-depolarizing muscle block (using neostigmine metilsulfate).  
IV over 1 minute:  
Neonate 50–80 micrograms/kg, after or with atropine.  
Infant or Child 50–80 micrograms/kg (maximum 2.5 mg) after or with atropine.

Renal impairment: Mild to moderate impairment: administer 50% of normal dose.
Severe impairment: administer 25% of normal dose.
Hepatic impairment: Dose reduction not necessary.
Adverse effects: Common Increased salivation, nausea, vomiting, abdominal cramps, diarrhoea, 

bradycardia.
Uncommon Thrombophlebitis, rash associated with bromide salt, signs of overdosage include 

bronchoconstriction, increased bronchial secretions, lacrimation, excessive sweating, involuntary 
defecation and micturition, miosis, nystagmus, heart block, arrhythmias, hypotension, agitation, 
excessive dreaming, weakness eventually leading to fasciculation and paralysis.

Interactions with other medicines (* indicates severe):
	 Amikacin: antagonism of effects of neostigmine.
	 Atropine: antagonism of effects of neostigmine.
	 Chloroquine: chloroquine has potential to increase symptoms of myasthenia gravis and thus 

diminish effect of neostigmine.
	 Clindamycin: antagonism of effects of neostigmine.
	 Gentamicin: antagonism of effect of neostigmine.
	 Paromomycin: possible antagonism.
	 Propranolol: antagonism of effect of neostigmine.
	 Streptomycin: antagonism of effect of neostigmine.
	 Suxamethonium: effect of suxamethonium enhanced.
	 Vecuronium: antagonism of muscle relaxant effect.
Notes: Simultaneous administration of an antimuscarinic drug such as atropine may be required to 

reduce the muscarinic side-effects of neostigmine; however it is not used routinely in treatment of 
myasthenia gravis as it can mask the signs of overdose.

Administration For intravenous injection, give undiluted or dilute with glucose 5% or sodium chloride 
0.9% or water for injections.
For treatment of myasthenia gravis, oral doses can be divided so that the patient receives the larger doses at the 
times of greatest fatigue.

bronchoconstriction, increased bronchial secretions, lacrimation, excessive sweating, involuntary 
defecation and micturition, miosis, nystagmus, heart block, arrhythmias, hypotension, agitation, 
excessive dreaming, weakness eventually leading to fasciculation and paralysis.

Interactions with other medicines (* indicates severe):
*	 Amikacin: antagonism of effect of pyridostigmine.
	 Atropine: antagonism of effect of pyridostigmine.
	 Chloroquine: chloroquine has potential to increase symptoms of myasthenia gravis and thus 

diminish effect of pyridostigmine.
	 Clindamycin: antagonism of effects of pyridostigmine.
*	 Gentamicin: antagonism of effect of pyridostigmine.
*	 Paromomycin: possible antagonism.
	 Propranolol: antagonism of effect of pyridostigmine.
*	 Streptomycin: antagonism of effect of pyridostigmine.
	 Suxamethonium: effect of suxamethonium enhanced.
	 Vecuronium: antagonism of muscle relaxant effect.
Notes: For treatment of myasthenia gravis, oral doses can be divided so that the patient receives the 

larger doses at the times of greatest fatigue.
Give 30–60 minutes before feeds in babies to improve suckling, but give after food or milk in older 

children/adults to reduce abdominal cramping.
Administration For IV injections, administer slowly over 2–4 minutes; patients receiving large parenteral 
doses should be pretreated with atropine. The patient must be closely observed for cholinergic reactions.

21	 Ophthalmological preparations

21	 Ophthalmological preparations
Administration of eye preparations
Preparations for the eye should be sterile when issued. Use of single application containers is preferable.
Eye drops are generally instilled into the lower conjunctival sac, which is accessed by gently  
pulling down the lower eyelid to form a pocket into which one drop is instilled. The eye should be 
kept closed for as long as possible after application, preferably 1–2 minutes. A small amount of eye 
ointment is applied similarly; the ointment melts rapidly and blinking helps to spread it. When two 
different eye drops are required at the same time, an interval of at least 5 minutes should be allowed 
between the two applications. Drops and ointment may both cause transient blurred vision. Systemic 
absorption can be minimized by using the finger to compress the lacrimal sac at the medial canthus 
(nasal aspect of the eye) for at least 1 minute after instillation of the drops.

21.1    Anti-infective agents
Acute infective bacterial conjunctivitis is treated with antibacterial eye drops by day and eye ointment 
applied at night. A poor response may indicate viral or allergic conjunctivitis. Corneal ulcer, keratitis 
and endophthalmitis require immediate specialist treatment.

Infant or Child 1 cm of ointment five times daily. Continue for at least 3 days after healing is 
complete.

Renal impairment: Dose reduction not necessary.
Hepatic impairment: Dose reduction not necessary.
Adverse effects: Common Local irritation including transient mild stinging, inflammation.
Uncommon Superficial punctate keratopathy.
Rare Blepharitis, hypersensitivity reactions including angioedema.
Interactions with other medicines (* indicates severe):
There are no known interactions involving a significant change in effect or where it is recommended 

to avoid concomitant use.
Notes: Avoid contaminating the tip of the ointment tube.

SECTION 23:
Peritoneal dialysis solution

448	 WHO Model Formulary for Children 2010



23      Peritoneal dialysis solution

23	 Peritoneal dialysis solution
Solutions for peritoneal dialysis are preparations for intraperitoneal use that contain electrolytes in a 
similar concentration to that in plasma, and also contain glucose or another suitable osmotic agent. 
Peritoneal dialysis is often preferred over haemodialysis in children, and is generally used in acute 
rather than chronic dialysis. It is unsuitable for patients who have had significant abdominal surgery.
In peritoneal dialysis, the solution is infused into the peritoneal cavity using the peritoneal mem-
brane as an osmotic membrane. There are two forms of peritoneal dialysis:
•	 continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD), in which dialysis is performed manually by the 

patient several times each day
•	 automated peritoneal dialysis (APD), in which dialysis is performed by machine overnight.
The main complication of peritoneal dialysis is peritonitis, which often results from poor exchange 
technique; infections of the catheter exit site may also occur. With long-term dialysis, progressive 
structural changes to the peritoneal membrane occur, ultimately resulting in dialysis failure. 

Intraperitoneal dialysis solution (of appropriate composition)
ATC code: B05DA
Indications: To correct electrolyte imbalance, fluid overload and to remove metabolites in renal 

failure.
Contraindications: Abdominal sepsis; severe inflammatory bowel disease.
Precautions: Previous abdominal surgery; care required with technique to reduce risk of infection; 

some drugs may be removed by dialysis.

Dose:
Individualized according to clinical condition and based on blood results. 

Initial dialysis ideally delayed for 2 weeks after insertion of catheter. Start with low volumes, e.g. 
10 ml/kg and gradually increase to maximum 50 ml/kg (1100 ml/m2) to avoid creating leak at 
catheter exit site.

Renal impairment: Dose reduction not necessary.
Hepatic impairment: Dose reduction not necessary.
Adverse effects: Uncommon Infection (including peritonitis), hernia, haemoperitoneum, 

hyperglycaemia, protein malnutrition, blocked catheter, pain on filling (related to acidic pH of 
some dialysis solutions), hypokalaemia with aggressive dialysis.

Interactions with other medicines (* indicates severe):
There are no known interactions involving a significant change in effect or where it is recommended 

to avoid concomitant use.
Notes: Warm dialysis solution to body temperature before use.
Increasing concentrations of glucose allow increasing efficiency of fluid removal (e.g. 1.5%, 2.3%, 

4.5%). Lower concentrations (e.g. 1.5%) are gentler and appropriate for maintenance. High 
osmolality solutions (e.g. 4.25%) can be used intermittently for severe fluid overload.

Solutions containing 1.5% of glucose may be used in the management of acute renal failure, 
uncontrolled hyperkalemia or oliguria in the presence of a rapid catabolic rate.

Solutions containing decreased sodium concentration are used to prevent post-dialysis 
hypernatraemia.

WHO Model Formulary for Children 2010	 449



23	 Peritoneal dialysis solution
Solutions containing acetate are used in patients with impaired lactate metabolism and also in 

patients with hepatic dysfunction or impaired tissue perfusion.
Solutions containing decreased magnesium concentrations (i.e. 0.5 mEq/l) are used for patients with 

hypermagnesaemia or in patients in whom increased oral magnesium intake is desirable.
Commercially available solutions do not usually contain potassium as the solutions are frequently 

used for removing potassium in patients with hyperkalaemia. Potassium may be added to the 
dialysis solution and used cautiously when necessary.

For further information, specialized references on peritoneal dialysis and the manufacturer’s product 
information (where available) should be consulted.

24.1    Medicines used in psychotic disorders
Antipsychotic drugs (neuroleptics) generally tranquillize without impairing consciousness or causing 
paradoxical excitement. In the short term, they are used to manage children with severe violent, 
threatening, aggressive or self-injurious behaviour that is not adequately controlled by other  
strategies. Treatment of chronic psychotic disorders (e.g. schizophrenia) involves both pharmacologi-
cal and psychosocial interventions. The lowest possible dose of antipsychotic drug that will prevent 
major exacerbations of florid symptoms is used for long-term management.
Withdrawal of antipsychotics after long-term therapy should be gradual and closely monitored, to 
avoid the risk of acute withdrawal syndromes or rapid relapse. Relapse may be delayed for several 
weeks. 

Chlorpromazine
ATC code: N05AA01

Injection: 25 mg (as hydrochloride)/ml in 2 ml ampoule
Oral liquid: 5 mg (as hydrochloride)/ml
Tablet: 10 mg, 25 mg, 50 mg and 100 mg (hydrochloride)

Owing to the risk of contact sensitization, pharmacists, nurses and other health workers should 
avoid direct contact with chlorpromazine; tablets should not be crushed and solutions should 
be handled with care.

Indications: Schizophrenia; autism; psychomotor agitation and violent behaviour; adjunct in severe 
anxiety; other psychotic disorders.

Contraindications: Impaired consciousness due to CNS depression; phaeochromocytoma; narrow 
angle glaucoma; bone marrow suppression; severe liver or cardiac disease; hypersensitivity to 
chlorpromazine (cross-sensitivity with other phenothiazines may exist); breastfeeding.

Precautions: Cardiovascular and cerebrovascular disorders; respiratory disease; parkinsonism; 
epilepsy; acute infections; renal and hepatic impairment (avoid if severe); history of jaundice; 
leukopenia (monitor blood counts if unexplained fever or infection); hypothyroidism; myasthenia 
gravis; prostatic hypertrophy; avoid abrupt withdrawal; patients should remain supine and the 
blood pressure monitored for 30 minutes after intramuscular injection.

Skilled tasks Warn patient or carer about the risk of undertaking tasks requiring attention or coordination, 
for example riding a bike or operating machinery.

Dose:
Childhood schizophrenia, autism, severe anxiety and other psychoses.  

Oral:  
Child 1–6 years 500 micrograms/kg every 4–6 hours adjusted according to response (maximum 
40 mg daily); 
6–12 years 10 mg three times daily, adjusted according to response (maximum 75 mg daily).

Relief of acute symptoms of psychoses (including psychomotor agitation and violent behaviour). 
Deep IM:  
Child 1–6 years 500 micrograms/kg every 6–8 hours (maximum 40 mg daily).

452	 WHO Model Formulary for Children 2010



24.1    Medicines used in psychotic disorders
Renal impairment: Start with small doses; increased cerebral sensitivity.
Hepatic impairment: Can precipitate coma; hepatotoxic.
Adverse effects: Common Sedation, anxiety, agitation, extrapyramidal side-effects (see below), 

orthostatic hypotension, tachycardia, blurred vision, mydriasis, constipation, nausea, dry mouth, 
urinary retention, weight gain, hyperprolactinaemia (may result in galactorrhoea, gynaecomastia, 
amenorrhoea or infertility), photosensitivity, phototoxicity and hyperpigmentation.

Uncommon or rare Cholestatic jaundice, allergic reactions (including urticaria, Stevens-Johnson 
syndrome), corneal and lens opacities, syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone (SIADH) 
secretion, hyperthermia, hypothermia, neuroleptic malignant syndrome (see below), anaemia, 
thrombocytopenia, agranulocytosis, venous thromboembolism, ECG changes (reversible, 
broadened QT interval), arrhythmias, cardiac arrest, sudden death, hepatic fibrosis, priapism, 
systemic lupus erythematosus, seizures, increased blood glucose (see Metabolic effects below), 
dysarthria, dysphagia.

Extrapyramidal side-effects Dystonias Torticollis, carpopedal spasm, trismus, perioral spasm and 
oculogyric crisis, as well as medical emergencies, such as laryngeal spasm and opisthotonos, may occur. Dystonias 
are more common in children and young adults and more likely with high doses. They often occur within 
24–48 hours of starting treatment or increasing dose and respond rapidly to anticholinergics. In some cases, 
treatment with a benzodiazepine may also prove helpful. It may be possible to reintroduce the drug at a lower 
dose or consider an alternative.
Akathisia A feeling of motor restlessness; usually occurs 2–3 days (up to several weeks) after starting treatment 
and may subside spontaneously. It is important to differentiate between akathisia and agitation secondary to 
psychosis. Akathisia tends to improve with dose reduction and deteriorate when the dose is increased; agitation 
due to psychosis tends to improve if the dose is increased and deteriorate if it is reduced.
Parkinsonism Characterized by features such as tremor, rigidity or bradykinesia; usually develops after weeks 
or months. Although usually reversible, symptomatic treatment is sometimes necessary. Short-term use of an 
anticholinergic may be helpful. If parkinsonism persists, consider reducing antipsychotic dose or switching to an 
alternative antipsychotic.
Tardive dyskinesia (TD) Characterized by involuntary movements of the face, mouth or tongue, and sometimes 
head and neck, trunk or limbs. TD may appear after medium to long-term treatment, or even after stopping the 
antipsychotic (particularly after suddenly stopping). Up to a third of people treated for 10 years with conventional 
antipsychotics will develop TD. There may be a slow improvement after the drug is withdrawn, particularly in 
young patients or early in the syndrome.
Neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS) A potentially fatal condition characterized by fever, 
marked muscle rigidity, altered consciousness and autonomic instability. The syndrome usually progresses rapidly 
over 24–72 hours. Elevation of serum creatine kinase concentration (skeletal muscle origin) and leukocytosis often 
occur. Not all typical signs need to be present for diagnosis. The incidence of NMS is greatest in young men. It 
does not always occur immediately after starting antipsychotic treatment, and may be seen after many months or 
years. Treatment involves ceasing the antipsychotic, general supportive care such as cooling, volume replacement 
and treatment of hyperkalaemia. Paralysis and mechanical ventilation may also be required.
Metabolic effects People with schizophrenia are at increased cardiovascular risk. Antipsychotic agents 
have been associated with increased blood glucose, weight gain and dyslipidaemia. Increases risk of type 2 
diabetes.
Interactions with other medicines (* indicates severe):
*	 Amitriptyline: increased risk of antimuscarinic adverse effects; increased plasma amitriptyline 

concentration; possibly increased risk of ventricular arrhythmias.
	 Amodiaquine: plasma concentration of chlorpromazine increased (consider reducing 

chlorpromazine dose).
	 Antacids (aluminium hydroxide; magnesium hydroxide): reduced absorption of 

chlorpromazine.

Dystonias Torticollis, carpopedal spasm, trismus, perioral spasm and oculogyric crisis, as well as medical 
emergencies, such as laryngeal spasm and opisthotonos, may occur. Dystonias are more common in children and 
young adults, and more likely with high doses. They often occur within 24–48 hours of starting treatment or 
increasing dose, and respond rapidly to anticholinergics. In some cases, treatment with a benzodiazepine may also 
prove helpful. It may be possible to reintroduce the drug at a lower dose, or consider an alternative.
Akathisia A feeling of motor restlessness; usually occurs 2–3 days (up to several weeks) after starting treatment 
and may subside spontaneously. It is important to differentiate between akathisia and agitation secondary to 
psychosis. Akathisia tends to improve with dose reduction and deteriorate when the dose is increased; agitation 
due to psychosis tends to improve if the dose is increased and deteriorate if it is reduced. Children may not 
complain of the sensation of akathisia in the same way as adults; monitor closely. Sedating agents such as 
haloperidol are more likely to impair cognition and therefore learning at school.
Parkinsonism Characterized by features such as tremor, rigidity or bradykinesia; usually develops after weeks 
or months. Although usually reversible, symptomatic treatment is sometimes necessary. Short-term use of an 
anticholinergic may be helpful. If parkinsonism persists, consider reducing antipsychotic dose or switching to an 
alternative antipsychotic (possibly an atypical agent).
Tardive dyskinesia (TD) Characterized by involuntary movements of the face, mouth or tongue, and sometimes 
head and neck, trunk or limbs. TD may appear after medium to long-term treatment, or even after stopping 
the antipsychotic (particularly after suddenly stopping). Diabetics and those with affective disorders appear to 
be at increased risk. Up to a third of people treated for 10 years with conventional antipsychotics will develop 
TD. There may be a slow improvement after the drug is withdrawn, particularly in young patients or early in the 
syndrome.
Neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS) All antipsychotics can cause NMS, a potentially fatal 
condition characterized by fever, marked muscle rigidity, altered consciousness and autonomic instability. The

SECTION 25:
Medicines acting on the respiratory tract

25.1	 Antiasthmatic medicines........................................................... 461

460	 WHO Model Formulary for Children 2010



25.1    Antiasthmatic medicines

25	 Medicines acting on the respiratory tract

25.1    Antiasthmatic medicines
Asthma is a chronic inflammatory disease characterized by episodes of reversible airways obstruction 
due to bronchial hyper-responsiveness. It generally presents as recurrent episodes of wheeze, cough, 
shortness of breath and/or chest tightness that responds to bronchodilators and anti-inflammatory 
drugs.
Classification based on severity is important when decisions have to be made about management. 
Acute exacerbations are divided into mild, moderate, severe or life threatening (critical). Chronic 
asthma can be divided by severity into infrequent episodic, frequent episodic or persistent (mild, 
moderate or severe).

Routes of delivery
Inhalation of medicines allows high concentrations to be delivered more effectively and rapidly to 
the airways, with systemic adverse effects being avoided or minimized. It is important that patients 
receive careful instruction in the use of pressurized (aerosol) inhalation using a metered-dose inhaler 
(MDI) with spacer device to obtain optimum results. For smaller children, a face mask will also 
enhance the delivery of inhaled medicines. It is important to check that patients continue to use their 
inhalers correctly. Solutions for nebulization are available for use in acute severe asthma.

Management of acute exacerbations of asthma
Severe asthma can be fatal and must be treated promptly and energetically. Acute severe asthma  
attacks require hospital admission where resuscitation facilities are immediately available.

Management of chronic asthma
The management of chronic asthma is undertaken in a stepwise fashion, using the least possible 
medications for adequate control. Monitoring control requires assessment of the number of acute 
attacks, the presence of interval symptoms, limitation to normal daily activities and the frequency 
of use of beta-agonists for acute relief. Medications may then be reduced or increased in a stepwise 
fashion as required.

Budesonide
ATC code: R03BA02

Inhalation (aerosol): 100 micrograms per dose; 200 micrograms per dose
Special Notes: This medicine is listed as a representative of its pharmacological class. Other 

medicines in the same class may have similar clinical performance and may be selected for local 
formularies based on availability and price. The information in this monograph only applies to the 
medicine listed here.

Indications: Prophylaxis of asthma.
Precautions: Systemic corticosteriod therapy may be required during periods of stress, such as severe 

infections or when airways obstruction or mucus prevent drug access to smaller airways.

Dose:
Prophylaxis of asthma. 

Inhalation:  
Child under 12 years 100–400 micrograms twice a day, adjusted as necessary.

WHO Model Formulary for Children 2010	 461



25	 Medicines acting on the respiratory tract
Renal impairment: Dose reduction not necessary.
Hepatic impairment: Dose reduction not necessary.
Adverse effects: Common Dysphonia (hoarse voice), oropharyngeal candidiasis (risk reduced by 

using a spacer device; rinsing the mouth with water or cleaning the child’s teeth after inhalation), 
bruising.

Rare Allergic reactions, including bronchospasm, rash, urticaria and angioedema.
Occurrence of systemic adverse effects depends on systemic absorption which is influenced by 

dosage, duration of treatment and the delivery system. Delivery direct to the lower respiratory 
tract is approximately 70% greater with the use of a spacer, and systemic adverse effects can be 
further reduced by rinsing mouth with water, gargling and spitting out after the use of the inhaler 
with spacer.

Interactions with other medicines (* indicates severe):
Interactions listed relate to systemically absorbed drug; consider relevance when using inhaled drug.
	 Ritonavir: ritonavir inhibits CYP3A4 and as such may increase the concentration of budesonide 

by inhibiting its metabolism. Cases of Cushing syndrome reported with concurrent use of 
fluticasone and ritonavir.

Notes: Patient advice After using this medicine rinse your mouth with water, gargle and spit out.
Do not use this medicine for immediate relief of symptoms.
Use this medicine every day even if you are feeling better; do not reduce dosage or stop this medicine unless 
instructed by your doctor.

464	 WHO Model Formulary for Children 2010



25.1    Antiasthmatic medicines
Lactic acidosis There are reports with high-dose intravenous and nebulized salbutamol. Respiratory 
compensation (increased respiratory rate and effort) due to increased lactate levels may be mistaken for worsening 
asthma.
Interactions with other medicines (* indicates severe):
	 Dexamethasone: increased risk of hypokalaemia if high doses of salbutamol given with 

dexamethasone.
	 Digoxin: possible reduced plasma concentration of digoxin.
	 Furosemide: increased risk of hypokalaemia with high doses of salbutamol.
	 Hydrochlorothiazide: increased risk of hypokalaemia with high doses of salbutamol.
	 Hydrocortisone: increased risk of hypokalaemia if high doses of salbutamol given with 

hydrocortisone.
	 Prednisolone: increased risk of hypokalaemia if high doses of salbutamol given with prednisolone.
Notes: Reserve nebulizer solution for life-threatening acute asthma.
Intravenous administration may be necessary in acute severe asthma, but has a higher risk of adverse 

effects than when inhaled (intramuscular and subcutaneous injection are rarely indicated). For 
intravenous administration, dilute to a concentration of 200 micrograms/ml with glucose 5%, 
sodium chloride 0.9% or water for injection.

For nebulization, dilute respirator solution with a suitable volume of sterile sodium chloride 0.9% 
according to the directions for the nebulizer being used.

Oral salbutamol treatment should only be considered when inhaled asthma therapy is not feasible. 
Oral administration is rarely used now due to systemic adverse effects.

26.1    Oral

26	 Solutions correcting water, electrolyte and 
acid-base disturbances

26.1    Oral
Oral rehydration salts are detailed elsewhere (see section 17.5.1), and potassium chloride  
is recommended as a powder for solution (see below).

Oral rehydration salts
ATC code: A07CA

Powder for dilution in 200 ml; 500 ml; 1 litre
Contains: glucose 13.5 g/l, sodium chloride 2.6 g/l, potassium chloride 1.5 g/l, trisodium citrate 
dihydrate 2.9 g/l
Provides: glucose 75 mmol/l, sodium 75 mEq or mmol/l, chloride 65 mEq or mmol/l, potassium 
20 mEq or mmol/l, citrate 10 mmol/l, osmolarity 245 mOsm/l

Special Notes: Oral rehydration salts are also referred to as ORS.
Known by the brand names Gastrolyte and Dioralyte.
Indications: Oral rehydration salts replace fluid and salts lost in acute diarrhoea.
Precautions: Renal impairment.

Dose:
WHO recommends Plans A, B and C; see below.
Plan A: no dehydration Nutritional advice, increased fluid intake (e.g. unsalted soup, 

unsalted rice water, yoghurt or plain water), at least one fluid that normally contains salt (e.g. 
ORS solution, salted drinks including salted rice water and vegetable or chicken soup with salt) 
and zinc supplementation (section 17.5.2) at home are usually sufficient. The aim is to give as 
much nutrient-rich food as the child will accept. Breastfeeding should always be continued to 
reduce the risk of diminishing supply. Give as much fluid as the child wants until diarrhoea 
stops and, as a guide, after each loose stool give: 
Child under 2 years 50–100 mL (a quarter to half a large cup) of fluid; 
2–10 years 100–200 ml (a half to one large cup); 
older than 10 years as much fluid as the child wants. 
Parents should be advised about circumstances in which they should seek further advice.

Plan B: moderate dehydration Whatever the child’s age, a 4 hour treatment plan is 
applied to avoid short-term problems. It is recommended that parents are shown how to give 
approximately 75 ml/kg of oral rehydration solution over a 4 hour period, and it is suggested 
that parents should be watched to see how they cope at the beginning of the treatment. A larger 
amount of solution (up to 20 ml/kg/hour and maximum 750 ml/hour) can be given if the child 
continues to have frequent stools or if the child wants more than the estimated amount of ORS 
solution, and there are no signs of overhydration (e.g. oedematous eyelids). In case of vomiting, 
rehydration must be discontinued for 10 minutes and then resumed at a slower rate. In younger 
children, breastfeeding should be continued on demand and the mother should be encouraged 
to do so; older children should receive milk and nutritious food as normal after completing the 
4 hours of oral rehydration. The child’s status must be reassessed after 4 hours to decide on the 
most appropriate subsequent treatment. If signs of dehydration worsen, shift to treatment plan C; 
and if the child develops signs of severe dehydration, intravenous rehydration should be started as 
per treatment plan C. Zinc supplementation (section 17.5.2) should begin as soon as the child can 
eat and has completed 4 hours of rehydration. Oral rehydration solution should continue to be 
offered once dehydration has been controlled, for as long as the child continues to have diarrhoea. 

WHO Model Formulary for Children 2010	 467



26	 Solutions correcting water, electrolyte and acid-base disturbances

Plan C: severe dehydration Hospitalization is necessary, but the most urgent priority 
is to start rehydration. The preferred treatment for children with severe dehydration is rapid 
intravenous rehydration. In hospital (or elsewhere), if the child can drink, oral rehydration 
solution should be given during intravenous rehydration (20 ml/kg/hour by mouth before 
infusion, then 5 ml/kg/hour by mouth during intravenous rehydration). For intravenous 
rehydration, it is recommended that compound solution of sodium lactate (or, if this is 
unavailable, sodium chloride 0.9% intravenous infusion) (see section 26.2) is administered at a 
rate adapted to the child’s age. 
Intravenous rehydration using compound sodium lactate solution or sodium chloride 0.9% 
infusion  
IV:  
Infant 30 ml/kg over 1 hour, then 14 ml/kg/hour for 5 hours.  
Child 30 ml/kg over 30 minutes, then 28 ml/kg/hour for 2.5 hours. 
If the intravenous route is unavailable, a nasogastric tube is also suitable for administering oral 
rehydration solution. 
Nasogastric rehydration using oral rehydration solution  
Nasogastric tube:  
Infant or Child 20 ml/kg/hour for 6 hours (total 120 ml/kg). 
If the child vomits, the rate of administration of the oral solution should be reduced. Reassess 
the child’s status after 3 hours (6 hours for infants) and continue treatment as appropriate with 
plan A, B or C.

Renal impairment: Dose reduction may be necessary. Monitor electrolytes carefully.
Hepatic impairment: Dose reduction not necessary.
Adverse effects: Common or uncommon Vomiting may indicate too rapid administration, 

hypernatraemia and hyperkalaemia may result from overdose in renal impairment or 
administration of too concentrated a solution.

Interactions with other medicines (* indicates severe):
There are no known interactions where it is recommended to avoid concomitant use.
Notes: Trisodium citrate dihydrate may be replaced by sodium hydrogen carbonate (sodium 

bicarbonate) 2.5 g/l. However, as the stability of this latter formulation is very poor under tropical 
conditions, it is only recommended when manufactured for immediate use.

Glucose salt solution:
sodium chloride 2.6 g/l of clean water
sodium citrate (dihydrate) 2.9 g/l of clean water
potassium chloride 1.5 g/l of clean water
glucose (anhydrous) 13.5 g/l of clean water.
When glucose and sodium citrate are not available, they may be replaced by:
sucrose (common sugar) 27 g/l of clean water
sodium bicarbonate 2.5 g/l of clean water.
Note The solution may be prepared either from prepackaged sugar/salt mixtures or from bulk substances 
and water. Solutions must be freshly prepared, preferably with recently boiled and cooled water. Accurate 
weighing and thorough mixing and dissolution of ingredients in the correct volume of clean water is important. 
Administration of more concentrated solutions can result in hypernatraemia.

Interactions with other medicines (* indicates severe):
*	 Ciclosporin: increased risk of hyperkalaemia.
*	 Enalapril: increased risk of severe hyperkalaemia.
*	 Spironolactone: risk of hyperkalaemia.

472	 WHO Model Formulary for Children 2010



26.2    Parenteral
Notes: Consider special storage requirements for intravenous potassium salts given that 

administration errors may lead to fatal outcomes.
Administration Peripheral and central line: dilute to 40 mmol/l or weaker (preferably use a pre-mixed 
solution) and infuse at a maximum rate of 0.2 mmol/kg/hour.
If central line access is available and in an ICU setting with ECG monitoring only: dilute to 120 mmol/l or 
weaker and infuse at a maximum rate of 0.4 mmol/kg/hour.
Monitoring during administration Hourly: check IV site for signs of extravasation and 
document volume infused.
Monitor serum potassium and pulse, respiratory rate, blood pressure, urine output and other electrolytes every 
4–6 hours until stable, then daily; repeat sample if haemolysed as this can result in a falsely elevated potassium result.
If potassium level is high: ensure blood sample was not haemolysed, was actually a venous sample and was not 
taken from the line where potassium was being infused. Repeat potassium measurement every 30–60 minutes. 
Hyperkalaemia may require treatment with calcium gluconate, insulin and glucose, salbutamol, calcium 
resonium, furosemide and sodium bicarbonate or other measures.

Sodium hydrogen carbonate
ATC code: B05XA02

Injectable solution: 1.4% isotonic (equivalent to Na+ 167 mmol/l, HCO -
3  167 mmol/l)

Solution: 8.4% in 10 ml ampoule (equivalent to Na+ 1000 mmol/l, HCO -
3  1000 mmol/l)

Avoid extravasation; may cause cellulitis and tissue necrosis due to the hypertonicity of sodium 
hydrogen carbonate. Preferably administer into a large vein.

Special Notes: Also known as sodium bicarbonate, sodium acid carbonate and NaHCO3.
Indications: Severe metabolic acidosis.
Contraindications: Metabolic or respiratory alkalosis; hypocalcaemia; hypochlorhydria; 

hypernatraemia; unknown abdominal pain; inadequate ventilation during cardiopulmonary 
resuscitation; excessive chloride losses. Not for intra-arterial or intra-osseous injection.

Precautions: Restrict intake in impaired renal function, congestive heart failure, hypertension, 
peripheral and pulmonary oedema; other sodium-retaining conditions.

Caution should be taken when administering to patients under 2 years as hypernatraemia due to 
rapid injection may occur. Maximum rate in children under 2 should be 10 mmol/minute.

Dose:
Severe metabolic acidosis. 

IV (by continuous infusion with 1.4% solution co-infused with isotonic sodium chloride, or by 
slow infusion of 8.4% solution): 
Neonate, Infant or Child mmol of HCO3 = 0.5 x weight (kg) x (24 - serum mmol of HCO3/l). 
Half the required volume of sodium hydrogen carbonate solution should be infused and the patient’s 
clinical progress and serum HCO3 should be monitored before giving the remaining half. 
1.4% solution contains, per 1 ml, 0.167 mmol of Na and 0.167 mmol of HCO3. 
8.4% solution contains, per 1 ml, 1 mmol of Na and 1 mmol of HCO3.

If acid-base status not available.

27      Vitamins and minerals
Dietary vitamin A is derived from two sources, preformed retinoids from animal sources such as 

liver, kidney, dairy produce and eggs (fish liver oils are the most concentrated natural source) 
and provitamin carotenoids which can be obtained from many plants; the latter are converted to 
retinol in the body but are less effectively utilized. Betacarotene is the most plentiful in food and 
can be found in carrots and dark green or yellow vegetables.

Recommended daily intake to prevent vitamin A deficiency 
Infant, 630 units.
Child 1–6 years, 670 units;
7–10 years, 830 units;
> 10 years, 1100–3330 units.
1 international unit (IU) vitamin A = 0.3 micrograms retinol.

SECTION 28:
Ear, nose and throat conditions in children

WHO Model Formulary for Children 2010	 487



28	 Ear, nose and throat conditions in children

28	 Ear, nose and throat conditions in children
Ear conditions
Pathology within the middle ear is categorized as acute otitis media (AOM), otitis media with 
effusion (OME) and chronic suppurative otitis media (CSOM). AOM is diagnosed by an acute 
(< 2 weeks) history of ear pain or pus draining from the ear and examination showing a red,  
inflamed, bulging, opaque ear drum or perforation with discharge. Treatment involves analgesia and 
oral antibiotics. Decongestants and antihistamines have no proven benefit in AOM management.
Mastoiditis, a complication of ear infections presenting with high fever and an often tender swelling 
behind the ear, should not be missed. Antibiotic treatment as well as a surgical opinion is usually 
warranted.

Nasal conditions
Conditions resulting in nasal congestion include allergic rhinitis, seasonal rhinitis and perennial 
rhinitis; sinusitis may also present with symptoms of nasal congestion and headaches.
Epistaxis is another common condition in children. If local pressure applied with the thumb and 
first finger over both sides of the nose is not sufficient to resolve the bleeding, other treatments may 
involve nasal creams, drops and jellies. Nasal packing or local cauterization may be required in  
difficult cases.

Throat conditions
Sore throat is a common presenting symptom in children, with most cases due to viral infections 
that do not need specific treatment other than oral fluids and simple oral analgesia (see section 2.1). 
Streptococcal pharyngitis (“strep throat”), caused by group A streptococci, is common in children 
5–15 years of age. It should be treated with a course of oral penicillin (see section 6.2) to minimize 
complications such as scarlet fever, glomerulonephritis and rheumatic heart disease.
Croup (laryngotracheobronchitis) is a viral infection of the upper airway. Management involves 
minimal handling of the child and the use of an oral steroid, while for severe symptoms nebulized 
epinephrine (adrenaline) may be needed.
Epiglottitis is a bacterial infection of the epiglottis, usually caused by Haemophilus influenzae type B 
(HiB). Rates of epiglottitis have declined dramatically since the introduction of HiB vaccinations in 
many regions. Epiglottitis presents with an unwell, febrile child, often sitting forwards and drooling. 
Medical personnel should never use a tongue depressor for oral examination as respiratory arrest 
may occur. Management is with parenteral antibiotics (see Section 6.2) in hospital, with protection 
of the airway when required. Bacterial tracheitis is a differential diagnosis of epiglottitis and requires 
parenteral antibiotics and, often, surgical drainage.

29      Specific medicines for neonatal care

29	 Specific medicines for neonatal care
Quality evidence for safety and efficacy of medicines in this population is lacking. The medicines listed in 
this section are for exclusive use in the neonatal age group. Other medicines listed in previous sections may 
be suitable for neonatal use; following local guidelines or using specialist supervision is always advised.

Respiratory
Apnoea of prematurity is a common phenomenon in those < 35 weeks gestation. Before consideration 
of treatment, other causes of apnoea must be excluded, including infection, respiratory disease, 
seizures and gastro-oesophageal reflux disease.
Surfactant is normally produced by the lungs to reduce surface tension in alveoli, thereby prevent-
ing atelectasis (lung collapse). A deficiency of natural surfactant is common in premature infants 
< 32 weeks gestation, thus treatment or prophylaxis of primary respiratory distress syndrome with 
surfactant (animal or synthetic), administered down the endotracheal tube, can be considered in this 
population. It may also be used in secondary surfactant deficiency in infants.

Cardiology (ductus arteriosus)
The ductus arteriosus, a fetal communication between the pulmonary artery and aorta, is required 
for adequate fetal circulation. In duct-dependent congenital cardiac lesions, closure of the ductus 
arteriosus (due to prostaglandin blockade) results in absence of adequate circulation. Prostaglandin 
E, a powerful vasodilator, is used to maintain or re-obtain a patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) until 
cardiac surgery is undertaken.
Premature infants are at an increased risk of PDA given the lack of natural prostaglandin blockade. 
An ongoing PDA, in a patient with otherwise normal cardiac anatomy, may lead to pulmonary 
congestion and heart failure, along with other complications. Ibuprofen, an NSAIM that blocks 
prostaglandin synthesis, is used to close a clinically significant PDA.

Caffeine citrate
ATC code: N06BC01

Injection: 20 mg/ml (equivalent to 10 mg caffeine base/ml)
Oral liquid: 20 mg/ml (equivalent to 10 mg caffeine base/ml)

Special Notes: Caffeine citrate, a respiratory stimulant, is used for neonatal apnoea in preterm infants 
(born less than 35 weeks gestational age and under 2 kg). It is preferred over theophylline, as 
caffeine has a better safety profile and does not require routine drug level monitoring. Other causes 
of neonatal apnoea should be sought and treated before treatment with caffeine is started (e.g. 
sepsis, hypothermia, hypoglycaemia, hypoxaemia, anaemia, seizures).

Indications: Neonatal apnoea in preterm infants.
Contraindications: Hypersensitivity to caffeine or citrate.
Precautions: Cardiovascular disorders; gastro-oesophageal reflux; seizure disorders.

Dose:
Note All doses expressed as caffeine citrate.
Neonatal apnoea. 

Oral or IV:  
Neonate 20 mg/kg as a loading dose, then 5 mg/kg once daily starting 24 hours after loading 
dose. Maintenance dose may be increased by 5 mg/kg every 24 hours to a maximum of  
20 mg/kg/day, unless side-effects develop. Continue 4–5 days after cessation of apnoea.

Note Caffeine citrate 2 mg = caffeine base 1 mg.

WHO Model Formulary for Children 2010	 493

Rare Following prolonged use, cortical proliferation of long bones, weakening of the wall of the 
ductus arteriosus and pulmonary artery have been reported.

Prostaglandin E2 Common Nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, flushing, bradycardia, hypotension, 
cardiac arrest, respiratory depression and apnoea (particularly with high doses and in low-birth-
weight neonates).

Uncommon Bronchospasm, fever, raised white blood cell count, shivering, local reactions, erythema.
Rare Following prolonged use (greater than 5 days), gastric outlet obstruction and cortical 

hyperostosis have been reported.
Interactions with other medicines (* indicates severe):
	 Prostaglandin E1: There are no known interactions involving a significant change in effect or 

where it is recommended to avoid concomitant use.
	 Prostaglandin E2: There are no known interactions involving a significant change in effect or 

where it is recommended to avoid concomitant use.
Notes: Prostaglandin E1 Dilute 150 micrograms/kg body weight to a final volume of 50 ml 

with glucose 5% or sodium chloride 0.9%.
An intravenous infusion rate of 0.1 ml/hour provides a dose of 5 nanograms/kg/minute.
Undiluted solution must not come into contact with the barrel of the plastic syringe; add the 

required volume of alprostadil to a volume of infusion fluid in the syringe and then make up to a 
final volume.

The solution may turn hazy if the undiluted solution comes into contact with the plastic syringe 
barrel. Discard the solution if it turns hazy.

Prepare a fresh solution every 24 hours.
Should be administered via a dedicated line and not mixed with other medications either via infusion 

or bolus.
Prostaglandin E2 Dilute to a concentration of 1 microgram/ml with glucose 5% or sodium 

chloride 0.9%.
For administration by mouth, injection solution can be given orally; dilute with water.

29	 Specific medicines for neonatal care

Surfactant
ATC code: R07AA02

Suspension for intratracheal instillation: 25 mg/ml or 80 mg/ml
Special Notes: Surfactant is available as beractant (bovine lung surfactant providing phospholipid 

25 mg/ml) and poractant alfa (porcine lung surfactant providing phospholipid 80 mg/ml).
Indications: Treatment and prophylaxis of respiratory distress syndrome (hyaline membrane disease) 

in preterm neonates.
Contraindications: There are no contraindications to the use of surfactant in preterm neonates.
Precautions: Continuous monitoring is required to avoid hyperoxaemia caused by rapid 

improvement in arterial oxygen concentration.

Dose:
Beractant 
Treatment of respiratory distress syndrome (hyaline membrane disease) in preterm neonates. 

Endotracheal tube:  
Neonate 100 mg/kg (equivalent to a volume of 4 ml/kg) preferably within 8 hours of birth. 
Dose may be repeated within 48 hours at intervals of at least 6 hours for up to four doses.  
Administer dose of beractant in four 1 ml/kg aliquots with infant in different position for each 
aliquot. Ventilator support or inspired oxygen may need to be temporarily increased.

Prophylaxis of respiratory distress syndrome (hyaline membrane disease) in preterm neonates. 
Endotracheal tube:  
Neonate 100 mg/kg as soon as possible after birth. Up to four doses may be administered in the 
first 48 hours of life, not more frequently than 6 hours apart.  
Administer dose of beractant in four 1 ml/kg aliquots with infant in different position for each 
aliquot. Ventilator support or inspired oxygen may need to be temporarily increased.

Poractant alfa 
Treatment of respiratory distress syndrome (hyaline membrane disease) in preterm neonates. 

Endotracheal tube:  
Neonate 100–200 mg/kg (equivalent to a volume of 1.25–2.5 ml/kg). If still intubated, two 
further doses of 100 mg/kg may be given at 12 hour intervals. Maximum total dose is  
400 mg/kg.

Prophylaxis of respiratory distress syndrome (hyaline membrane disease) in preterm neonates. 
Endotracheal tube:  
Neonate 100–200 mg/kg soon after birth (preferably within 15 minutes). Further doses of 
100 mg/kg may be repeated 6–12 hours later and after a further 12 hours if still intubated. 
Maximum total dose is 400 mg/kg.  
Administer dose of poractant in two aliquots with infant in different position for each aliquot to 
ensure delivery to the two main bronchi. Ventilator support or inspired oxygen may need to be 
temporarily increased.

Renal impairment: No dosage adjustment necessary.
Hepatic impairment: No dosage adjustment necessary.
Adverse effects: Rare Pulmonary haemorrhage has been rarely associated with pulmonary 

surfactants, especially in more preterm neonates. Obstruction of the endotracheal tube by mucus 
secretions has been reported.

Interactions with other medicines (* indicates severe):
There are no known interactions involving a significant change in effect or where it is recommended 

to avoid concomitant use.

498	 WHO Model Formulary for Children 2010



29      Specific medicines for neonatal care
Notes: Beractant and poractant alfa are not the same product. Consult product information for more 

details on administration.
Refrigerate and protect from light.
Do not shake. Gently swirl to ensure complete mixing of suspension.
Prior to administration, warm by standing at room temperature for 20 minutes or hold in hand 

for 8 minutes. Artificial warming methods should not be used. Do not use or return vials to the 
refrigerator if they have been at room temperature for 8 hours or more (beractant) or 24 hours or 
more (poractant alfa). Vials may only be returned to the refrigerator once after having reached 
room temperature.

Suction infant prior to administration.
Continuous monitoring of heart rate and transcutaneous oxygen saturation should be performed 

during administration.
Pneumothorax has occurred due to sudden changes in pulmonary compliance if ventilator settings 

are not appropriately adjusted.
Avoid suctioning the endotracheal tube for 2 hours post-administration unless there are clear signs of 

airway obstruction.
