Executive summary of the report of the 24th WHO Expert Committee on the Selection and Use of Essential Medicines 

 

Declaration of Interests 
To be effective, the work of WHO and the contributions of its experts must be, and must be perceived to be, 
objective and independent. In this regard, to ensure the highest integrity and public confidence in its activities, 
WHO requires that experts serving in an advisory role disclose any circumstances that could give rise to a 
potential or reasonably perceived conflict of interest related to the subject of the activity in which they will be 
involved. Declarations of interest and management of any disclosures is an important process governed by 
the WHO Guidelines for Declaration of Interests (WHO Experts). More information regarding WHO’s policy on 
declarations of interest is available on the WHO website1. 

Prior to being invited to participate in the 24th meeting of the WHO Expert Committee on Selection and Use 
of Essential Medicines, all experts submitted written declarations of interest. In reviewing and assessing the 
declarations of interest, the WHO Essential Medicines List Secretariat sought the advice of the Office of 
Compliance, Risk Management and Ethics.  

The declaration of interest process resulted in the participation of the Expert Committee Members and 
Temporary Advisers, as reported in the list of participants. 

Experts who declared having no conflicts of interest were Elie Akl, Zeba Aziz, Francesco Ceppi, Abdol Majid 
Cheraghali, Pem Chuki, Patrick Okwen, Ilisabeta Pesamino, Gabriela Prutsky-Lopez, Sangeeta Sharma, Fatima 
Suleman and Indah Widyahening. 

The following experts disclosed interests, which were assessed by the Secretariat for actual or potential 
conflicts and management strategies (if required): 

Loice Achieng Ombajo disclosed receiving honoraria from GSK to serve on a scientific advisory board for the 
Africa Open Lab research programme, from ViiV Healthcare to serve on a scientific advisory board on HIV and 
Aging, and from Astra Zeneca to serve on a COVID-19 advisory board. She also disclosed having received 
honoraria from Astra Zeneca, Merck Sharp and Dohme and Mylan Laboratories for speaker engagements and 
conference travel on topics not related to medicines under evaluation at this meeting. All payments were 
below the threshold of significant financial interest. Dr Achieng Ombajo also disclosed funding to her 
institution (University of Nairobi) from ViiV Healthcare and Gilead Sciences for investigator-initiated clinical 
trials on medicines for HIV (not under evaluation at this meeting), for which she is the principal investigator. 
Dr Ombajo is the clinical lead of two country grant programs, the first to improve surveillance 
of Candida auris in Kenya (funded by the Centers for Diseases Control and Prevention) and the second to 
improve antimicrobial surveillance (funded by the Fleming Fund). These disclosures were considered minor, 
unrelated to the subject matter of the Expert Committee meeting and did not require further management. 

Rita Banzi disclosed research funding to her research unit and institution (Mario Negri Institute for 
Pharmaceutical Research) below the threshold of significant financial interest from Janssen Pharmaceuticals 
to support an educational programme for systematic review methodology. She also disclosed funding to her 
research unit and institution from AC.TA .s.r.l. to support a series of ongoing investigator-initiated clinical trials 
on the use of hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy (HIPEC) for the treatment of different cancers. No 
personal salary support was received. These disclosures were considered minor, unrelated to the subject 
matter of the Expert Committee meeting and did not require further management. 

Carlos Alberto Cuello Garcia disclosed an appointment as senior research officer by the Canadian Agency for 
Drugs and Technology in Health (CADTH). In this capacity Dr Cuello prepares evaluations of medicines that are

presented to Agency’s policymakers to make reimbursement decisions. This disclosure was considered not to 
represent a conflict and did not require further management. 

Elisabeth de Vries disclosed that she serves as an expert in data safety monitoring committees for an ongoing 
trial investigating atezolizumab in adjuvant breast cancer sponsored by a non-profit research program 
(National Surgical Adjuvant Breast and Colon Project) and for a completed trial investigating trastuzumab 
deruxtecan in advanced breast cancer sponsored by a for-profit company (Daiichi Sankyo). Dr de Vries also 
disclosed that she provides advice to Crescendo Biologics on improving the quality of the design and conduct 
of preclinical and phase I clinical studies exploring biological activity of bispecific molecules for the treatment 
of cancers. Sponsors provide funding to Dr de Vries’ institution (University Medical Center Groningen) to cover 
her time commitment.  

She also disclosed that her institution is involved in early phase clinical trials to explore the therapeutic and 
diagnostic/prognostic roles of cancer medicines and biomarkers. Her institution receives institutional funding 
from Amgen, Bayer, CytomX, Crescendo Biologics, Genetech, G1 Therapeutics, Regeneron, Roche, Servier and 
Synthon. No personal salary support was received. The trials concerned were not considered to be directly 
related to medicines under evaluation at the Expert Committee meeting. 

She disclosed that she is a current member of the European Society for Medical Oncology Magnitude of Clinical 
Benefit Scale Working Group, having served as its Chair from 2013 to 2019, and is a current member of the 
Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumours Working Group, having been its co-chair from 2009 to 2022. 
She has served as the Chair of the EML Cancer Medicines Working Group since 2020 and was involved in the 
Working Group’s evaluation of cancer medicine applications under consideration at the Expert Committee 
meeting. All these positions are unpaid. 

These disclosures were considered to be unrelated, or not directly related, to the subject matter of the Expert 
Committee meeting and did not require further management. 

Wei Hao disclosed that was the principal investigator of a phase II clinical trial evaluating a long-acting 
naltrexone implant to treat opioid dependence sponsored by Shenzhen Sciencare Medical Industries. He 
disclosed having received honoraria in relation to the conduct of the trial, below the threshold for significant 
financial interest. The sponsors provided funding to Dr Hao’ institution (Second Xiangya Hospital, Central 
South University) to cover trial costs. Naltrexone (oral formulation and extended-release injection) is a 
medicine under evaluation at the Expert Committee meeting for treatment of alcohol use disorder. This 
disclosure was considered to represent an ostensible conflict of interest. A determination was made that he 
should be excluded from the deliberation and recommendation for the application for naltrexone. He recused 
himself from the meeting while the application for naltrexone was being discussed. 

Claudia Garcia Serpa Osorio de Castro disclosed that she has received grant funding for consultancy work from 
Oswaldo Cruz Foundation Funding Agency to support a project on litigation for access to high-cost medicines 
sponsored by the Brazilian Ministry of Health, and research grant funding from the National Council for 
Scientific and Technological Development, a foundation linked to the Brazilian Ministry of Science and 
Technology, to support masters and PhD students involved in comparative effectiveness research.  These 
disclosures were considered not to represent a conflict and did not require further management. 

Mike Sharland disclosed that his institution (St George’s University of London) has received research funding 
from GARDP to support the development of academic activities, including observational cohort studies, and 
monitoring antibiotic use in children. GARDP is funded exclusively from independent, non-commercial 
sources. He also disclosed that he is the Vice Chair and Board Member of the Penta Foundation, an Italian

Charitable Foundation, that globally supports trials to advance treatments for pediatric infectious 
diseases. Penta collaborates with multiple drug companies on the optimal design and conduct of observational 
and interventional trials of medicines. He has served as the Chair of the EML Antimicrobials Working Group 
since 2017 and was involved in the Working Group’s evaluation of antibiotic applications under consideration 
at the Expert Committee meeting. Both positions are unpaid. These disclosures were considered not to 
represent a conflict and did not require further management. 

He also disclosed that he is the chief investigator of the ongoing PediCAP trial, an EU-funded study, comparing 
amoxicillin to amoxicillin + clavulanic acid in children admitted to hospital with severe pneumonia in Africa. 
Sandoz is donating amoxicillin + clavulanic dispersible tablets for the trial. He also disclosed that he is the chief 
investigator of the NeoSEP1 trial, funded by the Global Antibiotic Research and Development Partnership 
(GARDP) and the European & Developing Countries Clinical Trials Partnership (EDCTP), which compares novel 
combinations of generic antibiotics to treat neonatal sepsis. The antibiotics under study include fosfomycin, 
provided by InfectoPharm, and flomoxef, provided by Shionogi & Co. Both positions are unpaid. Applications 
for amoxicillin + clavulanic acid dispersible tablets (submitted by Sandoz) and flomoxef (submitted by GARDP) 
were under evaluation at the Expert Committee meeting. These disclosures were considered to represent an 
ostensible conflict of interest. A determination was made that he should be excluded from the deliberation 
and recommendation for the applications for amoxicillin + clavulanic acid dispersible tablets and flomoxef. He 
recused himself from the meeting while these applications were being discussed. 

Zoubida Tazi Mezalek disclosed financial support below the threshold for significant financial interest from 
pharmaceutical companies (Hikma, Janssen, AfricPhar, and Health Innovation) for reimbursement of travel 
and accommodation expenses for attendance at conferences. She also disclosed that she served as an 
investigator in an observational study sponsored by Servier and a phase IV study sponsored by Roche. These 
disclosures were considered minor, unrelated to the subject matter of the Expert Committee meeting and did 
not require further management.

Executive summary 
The meeting of the 24th WHO Expert Committee on the Selection and Use of Essential Medicines took place 
in person in Geneva, Switzerland, from 24 to 28 April 2023. The aim of the meeting was to review and update 
the 22nd WHO Model List of Essential Medicines (EML) and the 8th WHO Model List of Essential Medicines 
for Children (EMLc) (the “Model Lists”).  

Essential medicines are those that satisfy the priority health care needs of a population. They are selected with 
due regard to disease prevalence and public health relevance, evidence of efficacy and safety and comparative 
cost-effectiveness. They are intended to be available in functioning health systems at all times, in appropriate 
dosage forms, of assured quality and at prices individuals and health systems can afford. 

The WHO Model Lists are updated every two years, intended as a guide for countries or regional authorities 
to adopt or adapt in accordance with local priorities and treatment guidelines for the development and 
updating of national essential medicines lists. Selection of a limited number of essential medicines as essential, 
taking into consideration national disease burden and clinical need can lead to improved access through 
streamlined procurement and distribution of quality-assured medicines, support more rational or appropriate 
prescribing and use and lower costs for both health care systems and for patients. 

The Expert Committee considered a total of 85 applications, including 52 proposals for the addition of new 
medicines or medicine classes, 9 proposals for new indications for 22 currently listed medicines, 9 proposals 
for the addition of new formulations of currently listed medicines, and 6 proposals for the removal of 13 
medicines, formulations or indications, and 9 proposals for other changes to current listings on the Model 
Lists. In accordance with applicable procedures2, the Expert Committee reviewed and evaluated the scientific 
evidence for the effectiveness, safety and comparative cost-effectiveness of the medicines in question. The 
Committee also considered a review of the age-appropriateness of formulations of essential medicines for 
children on the EMLc. 

In summary, the Expert Committee: 

● recommended the addition of 24 new medicines to the EML (15 to the core list and 9 to the 
complementary list); 

● recommended the addition of 12 new medicines to the EMLc (8 to the core list and 4 to the 
complementary list); 

● recommended adding additional indications for 16 currently listed medicines;  
● recommended the addition of new formulations of 19 medicines on the EML and of 48 medicines on 

the EMLc; 
● recommended the deletion of 3 medicines from the EML and 3 medicines from the EMLc and of 

specific formulations of a further 12 medicines from the EML and 23 medicines from the EMLc; and 

● did not recommend proposals for inclusion, change or deletion for 32 medicines, medicine classes or 
formulations. 

The recommended changes bring the total number of medicines (including fixed-dose combinations) on the 
EML to 502 (from 479 in 2021), including 361 on the EMLc (from 350 in 2021).

Executive summary of the report of the 24th WHO Expert Committee on the Selection and Use of Essential Medicines 

 

Section 1: Anaesthetics, preoperative medicines and medical gases 
Section 1.1.1 Inhalational medicines 
The Expert Committee recommended the inclusion of sevoflurane as an inhalational anaesthetic on the core 
list EML and EMLc based on evidence of similar efficacy and safety to currently listed isoflurane. The 
Committee noted that sevoflurane has a lower global warming potential than other volatile anaesthetics, 
particularly desflurane, which is not listed as an essential medicine, but also halothane and isoflurane, which 
are both currently included. More efficient use of sevoflurane, in preference to other inhalational 
anaesthetics, can contribute to reducing greenhouse gas emissions and the environmental impact of climate 
change. 

Section 2: Medicines for pain and palliative care 
Section 2.2 Opioid analgesics 
The Expert Committee did not recommend the inclusion of fast-acting oral transmucosal formulations of 
fentanyl citrate on the EML for the treatment of breakthrough cancer pain based on significant incremental 
costs compared to immediate-release oral morphine, which were considered disproportionate to the marginal 
incremental benefits. The Committee also noted that fentanyl has much higher potency and more drug-
interactions than other opioids, which limit its manageability. The Committee was also concerned that 
transmucosal fentanyl formulations have greater potential for misuse and addiction.  

Section 5: (re-named) Medicines for diseases of the nervous system  
This section of the Model Lists has been re-named from “Anticonvulsants/antiepileptics” to “Medicines for 
diseases of the nervous system” and includes new sub-sections for antiseizure medicines, medicines for 
multiple sclerosis, and medicines for parkinsonism (formerly listed in Section 9). 

The Expert Committee did not recommend inclusion of donepezil on the EML for the treatment of dementia 
due to Alzheimer disease. The Committee noted that moderate certainty evidence suggested donepezil may 
be associated with short-term improvements on cognitive outcome scores compared with placebo. However, 
these improvements are unlikely to be clinically meaningful. The Committee noted that the evidence suggests 
that the effect on activities of daily living is limited, while the available evidence suggests no impact on 
behavioural symptoms and quality of life, and lack of longer-term clinical cognitive benefits. The Committee 
noted that adverse effects of donepezil are generally mild, but the risk increases with higher doses, (those 
associated with greater cognitive benefits in the short-term), and the potential for numerous drug-drug and 
drug-disease interactions. The Committee considered that the patients included in dementia trials are 
generally younger and characterized by a better performance than patients seen in routine dementia care, 
affecting the generalizability of trial results. Consequently, the Committee considered the overall benefit to 
harm profile of the medicine to be unfavourable.  

The Expert Committee did not recommend inclusion of risdiplam on the core list of the EML and EMLc for 
treatment of spinal muscular atrophy. The Committee noted that the body of evidence for efficacy and safety 
of risdiplam in spinal muscular atrophy is still limited, with only a small number of patients exposed to long-
term treatment. The Committee, therefore, considered that the overall magnitude and long-term duration of 
benefits and potential harms were still uncertain. The Committee noted that based on the available evidence 
in patients with symptomatic disease, improvements in motor function were observed in younger children 
(below 5 years) but that these improvements became increasingly less prominent in older children, 
adolescents and adults. The Committee took note of ongoing clinical trials of risdiplam in presymptomatic 
infants up to 6 weeks of age and the introduction of routine newborn screening for spinal muscular atrophy 

3

in some settings and considered that the outcomes of these trials and screening programmes would be 
informative for future consideration of risdiplam for inclusion on the Model Lists. 

Section 5.1 (new sub-section) Antiseizure medicines  
The Expert Committee recommended the inclusion of oral levetiracetam on the core list of the EML and EMLc 
for the treatment of focal-onset and generalized-onset seizures in adults in children. The Committee also 
recommended the inclusion of parenteral levetiracetam on the complementary list of the EML and EMLc for 
use in the management of benzodiazepine-refractory status epilepticus. These recommendations were made 
based on evidence of effectiveness and safety, and in recognition of the need for treatment strategies for 
people with epilepsy to be individualized taking into account multiple factors including, but not limited to, 
pregnancy and patient preferences, seizure type, co-morbidities, and concomitant use of other medications. 
These recommendations are also aligned with expected recommendations in the updated WHO Mental Health 
Gap Action Programme (mhGAP) guidelines. 

Section 5.2 (new sub-section) Medicines for multiple sclerosis  
The Expert Committee recommended the inclusion of cladribine, glatiramer acetate and rituximab as 
individual medicines on the complementary list of the EML for the treatment of multiple sclerosis. The 
Committee did not recommend the inclusion of ocrelizumab for this indication, either as an individual 
medicine, or as a therapeutic alternative to rituximab under a square-box listing. 

The Committee noted that multiple sclerosis is the most common non-traumatic cause of neurological 
disability in young adults, with approximately 2.8 million people living with multiple sclerosis worldwide. Until 
now, the EML has not included any medicines for the treatment of multiple sclerosis. The Committee 
considered that the inclusion of effective and safe treatments for multiple sclerosis on the EML would address 
an important public health need and support global advocacy efforts to reduce the global burden of multiple 
sclerosis, especially in low and middle-income countries. 

The Committee acknowledged the availability of a large number of disease-modifying medicines for multiple 
sclerosis (particularly for the treatment of relapsing and remitting forms of the disease) and the need to 
prioritize the most effective, tolerable, and affordable options. The Committee considered that the approach 
taken in the application submitted by the Multiple Sclerosis International Federation (MSIF) to identify which 
medicines to prioritize for EML listing from among the many available was comprehensive, up-to-date, 
transparent, robust and evidence based. The Committee recognized the value of involving different 
organizations and stakeholders at the global level, including consultation with people living with multiple 
sclerosis. The Committee considered that the application’s selection of cladribine, glatiramer acetate and 
rituximab as priority medicines for EML inclusion was well justified and supported by evidence of clinical 
benefit and safety across different settings, as well as suitability for use in different patient populations (e.g. 
pregnant women) and feasibility. The inclusion on the EML of three medicines, with different routes of 
administration, different prices (including the availability of generics and biosimilars) and different 
recommended uses, would provide valuable options for patients and national selection decisions and could 
facilitate improved access to treatment for people living with multiple sclerosis. The Committee acknowledged 
that rituximab does not have market authorization by regulatory authorities for treatment of multiple sclerosis 
and is thus used “off-label” for this indication. The Committee reiterated that the Model List can play an 
important role identifying those medicines for which off-label use is supported by convincing evidence, 
complementing the assessment and labeling by jurisdictional authorities. 

The Committee acknowledged the benefits of ocrelizumab in the management of relapsing and primary 
progressive forms of multiple sclerosis. However, there was no compelling evidence of its superiority over 

4

other alternatives, specifically rituximab, which has the same target (CD20) and a similar peptide sequence, is 
widely used, more affordable and reimbursed for use in multiple sclerosis in several countries. The Committee 
considered the option of listing ocrelizumab as alternative to rituximab, but also recognized the large 
difference in current prices of the two products which decreases ocrelizumab competitiveness. The 
Committee concluded that including ocrelizumab as a therapeutic alternative to rituximab could result in 
considerable additional expenditure at country level for patients and health systems, without offering 
additional clinical benefit. 

Section 6: Anti-infective medicines 
Section 6.2.1 Access group antibiotics 
The Expert Committee recommended the inclusion of a new strength, child-friendly dispersible tablet 
formulation of amoxicillin + clavulanic acid (200 mg + 28.5 mg) as an Access group antibiotic on the core list of 
the EMLc for treatment of bacterial infections in children – specifically those infections for which amoxicillin + 
clavulanic acid is already recommended on the EMLc. The Committee noted that the 7:1 ratio of amoxicillin to 
clavulanic acid is associated with similar efficacy to the 4:1 ratio but has a reduced frequency of 
gastrointestinal adverse effects. The Committee endorsed the importance of age-appropriate formulations to 
better meet the dosing needs of children. 

Section 6.2.2 Watch group antibiotics 
The Expert Committee did not recommend inclusion of flomoxef sodium as a Watch group antibiotic on the 
EML and EMLc for empiric treatment of community acquired mild/moderate intraabdominal and upper 
urinary tract infections caused by extended-spectrum β-lactamase-producing Enterobacterales because of 
uncertainty in the available evidence. 

Section 6.2.3 Reserve group antibiotics 
The Expert Committee recommended the inclusion of ceftolozane + tazobactam as Reserve group antibiotic 
on the complementary list of the EML and EMLc for the treatment of infections caused or suspected to be 
caused by carbapenem-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa, a “Critical” priority pathogen on the 2017 WHO 
Priority Pathogens List. The Committee acknowledged that the clinical evidence for efficacy of ceftolozane + 
tazobactam against this specific pathogen is limited but considered that the availability of carbapenem-sparing 
alternatives for treatment of drug-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa was important as part of the strategy to 
limit/prevent further emergence and spread of carbapenem-resistant organisms. 

The Committee did not recommend inclusion of imipenem + cilastatin + relebactam as a Reserve group 
antibiotic on the complementary list of the EML and EMLc for the treatment of infections caused by multidrug-
resistant organisms. The Committee noted that imipenem + cilastatin + relebactam lacks in vitro activity 
against the carbapenemase genotypes most commonly associated globally with carbapenem resistance in 
Enterobacterales and that other antibiotics with similar spectrum of activity (e.g. cefiderocol, ceftazidime + 
avibactam, meropenem + vaborbactam) are already included as Reserve antibiotics on the Model Lists.  

The Committee recommended inclusion of tedizolid phosphate on the complementary list of the EML as a 
Reserve group antibiotic for the treatment of infections caused or suspected to be caused by multidrug-
resistant Gram-positive pathogens (methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, vancomycin-resistant 
enterococci), as an alternative to linezolid under a square box listing. The recommendation was based on 
evidence indicating that tedizolid is non-inferior to linezolid for the treatment of acute bacterial skin and skin 
structure infections, with a lower incidence of adverse events. However, the Committee observed that 
tedizolid phosphate is currently less widely available and considerably more expensive than linezolid.

Update to the AWaRe (Access, Watch, Reserve) classification of antibiotics 
No changes were recommended to the classification of antibiotics as Access, Watch or Reserve. The 2023 
AWaRe classification database will be updated to reflect the recommended inclusion of ceftolozane + 
tazobactam on the EML and EMLc and of tedizolid phosphate as a therapeutic alternative to linezolid on the 
EML. The AWaRe classification database is available at Web Annex C. 

Section 6.2.5 Antituberculosis medicines 
The Expert Committee recommended the inclusion of ethionamide on the core list of the EML and EMLc for 
the new indication for treatment of drug-susceptible tuberculosis meningitis in children and adolescents, as 
part of a 6-month intensive regimen in combination with isoniazid, rifampicin and pyrazinamide. The 
Committee also recommended the inclusion of pretomanid on the complementary list of the EML for 
treatment of multidrug-resistant or rifampicin-resistant tuberculosis, in a combination regimen with 
bedaquiline, linezolid with or without moxifloxacin.  

The Committee recommended deletion from the EML and/or EMLc of various formulations and strengths of 
amikacin, ethambutol, ethionamide, isoniazid, linezolid, p-aminosalicylic acid and pyrazinamide, noting that 
they are not optimal formulations and strengths for tuberculosis treatment. A new strength formulation of p-
aminosalicylic acid (as p-aminosalicylate sodium) was recommended for inclusion to replace the previously 
listed one which has been discontinued by the only manufacturer. The Committee also recommended that 
the age restrictions associated with the listings for bedaquiline and delamanid on the EML and EMLc should 
be removed. 

These recommendations are fully aligned with recommendations in current WHO guidelines for tuberculosis. 

Section 6.4.4.2 Medicines for hepatitis C 
The Expert Committee recommended the inclusion of ravidasvir on the core list of the EML as a therapeutic 
alternative under the square box listing for pangenotypic direct-acting antivirals for the treatment of chronic 
hepatitis C virus infection in adults. Ravidasvir is pangenotypic when used in combination with sofosbuvir. The 
recommendation was made based on evidence of effectiveness and safety, similar to that seen with other 
pangenotypic direct-acting antiviral regimens. 

The Committee also recommended deletion of non-pangenotypic treatment options for hepatitis C virus 
infection (dasabuvir, ombitasvir + paritaprevir + ritonavir, and pegylated interferon alfa 2a and 2b) from the 
core list of the EML. These treatments are no longer recommended in WHO guidelines for treatment of 
hepatitis C. 

Section 6.7 (new sub-section) Medicines for Ebola virus disease 
The Expert Committee recommended the addition of the monoclonal antibodies ansuvimab and atoltivimab 
+ maftivimab + odesivimab to the core list of the EML and EMLc for the treatment of confirmed Ebola virus 
disease caused by Zaire ebolavirus in adults and children, and in neonates of unconfirmed infection status 
aged 7 days old or younger, born to mothers with confirmed infection. The Committee noted that Ebola virus 
disease is a life-threatening disease with a high case-fatality rate, for which effective treatments are of public 
health importance. The Committee considered that the available clinical trial evidence for ansuvimab and 
atoltivimab + maftivimab + odesivimab has demonstrated important reductions in mortality compared to 
standard supportive care alone. The Committee considered that their inclusion on the Model Lists would 
represent a strong equity and advocacy message, fully aligned with WHO guidelines, that could contribute to 

6 



The selection and use of essential medicines 2023 
Executive summary of the report of the 24th WHO Expert Committee on the Selection and Use of Essential Medicines 

 

broader actions being undertaken to ensure reliable, affordable access to quality-assured therapeutics for 
Ebola virus disease. 

Section 6.8 (new sub-section) Medicines for COVID-19  
Taking account of the global recognition of the need for effective therapeutics to prevent and treat COVID-19, 
as well as the need to ensure adequate and affordable access globally to these treatments, the Expert 
Committee recommended that effective and safe therapeutics for COVID-19 should be considered as essential 
medicines and should therefore be prioritized by countries for national selection and procurement. However, 
the Committee also recognized the continued rapid evolution of the evidence base for COVID-19 therapeutics, 
which contrasts with the 2-year update cycle of the Model Lists. Furthermore, the evolution of the SARS-CoV-
2 virus, combined with changing population immunity may influence disease severity and thus have an impact 
on the relative and absolute benefits associated with COVID-19 therapeutics. The Committee considered that 
in the context of public health emergencies, there is a risk in listing medicines on the WHO Model Lists that 
later must be removed because they are no longer relevant for the reasons outlined above, a scenario that 
ideally should be avoided. The Committee recommended that countries should refer to WHO and national 
guidelines as tools to orient prioritization of medicines during public health emergencies. 

The Expert Committee recommended a new section be added to the EML and EMLc for COVID-19 therapeutics, 
but that specific, individual medicines should not be listed at this time. Rather, the Committee recommended 
that this section of the Model Lists should direct national decision makers to the WHO living guidelines for 
COVID-19 therapeutics, noting that these are being revised and updated regularly. Importantly, these living 
guidelines also include recommendations for use of other medicines already included on the Model Lists (e.g. 
dexamethasone, oxygen), as well as recommendations against the use of medicines that are included on the 
Model Lists for other indications (e.g. hydroxychloroquine, lopinavir-ritonavir). 

Section 8: Immunomodulators and antineoplastics 
Section 8.1 Immunomodulators for non-malignant disease 
The Expert Committee did not recommend the inclusion of sub-cutaneous injection formulations of 
methotrexate on the EML and EMLc for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, juvenile idiopathic arthritis, 
psoriasis and arthritic psoriasis and Crohn disease in patients not responding to maximum tolerable doses of 
oral methotrexate. The Committee noted that methotrexate is one of the mainstays of treatment for these 
conditions, but that data on clinical efficacy and safety of subcutaneous methotrexate compared to oral or 
intramuscular formulations are limited and are based mostly on studies in patients with rheumatoid arthritis. 
Overall, the Committee considered the possible benefits of subcutaneous compared to oral methotrexate 
were unclear, and with limited available evidence suggesting only modest benefits in a small proportion of 
patients, at a considerably higher price. 

Section 8.2 Antineoplastic and supportive medicines 
A total of 12 applications for cancer medicines were considered by the Expert Committee. These included 
requests for inclusion of new cancer medicines, and requests for new indications for already listed cancer 
medicines. Three applications (PD-1/PD-L1 immune checkpoint inhibitors for non-oncogene-addicted locally 
advanced and metastatic non-small cell lung cancer, osimertinib for EGFR mutated locally advanced or 
metastatic non-small cell lung cancer and cyclin-dependent kinase 4/6 inhibitors for hormone-receptor 
positive/HER2-negative advanced breast cancer) were resubmissions following recommendations not to list 
made by the 2021 Expert Committee. All applications were reviewed by the EML Cancer Medicines Working

Group prior to the meeting, who provided written comments to inform the Expert Committee’s 
considerations. 

Expert Committee recommendations to include new cancer and supportive medicines: 
− The inclusion of pegylated liposomal doxorubicin on the complementary list of the EML and EMLc for 

the treatment of Kaposi sarcoma. The Committee noted evidence that pegylated liposomal 
doxorubicin is associated with similar or improved survival benefits and reduced harms in comparison 
to non-liposomal doxorubicin and other routinely used chemotherapies, and pegylated doxorubicin is 
a preferred therapeutic alternative to paclitaxel in children as the experience with paclitaxel in this 
setting is still rather limited. 

− The inclusion of pegfilgrastim (including quality-assured biosimilars) on the complementary list of the 
EML and EMLc for primary prophylaxis in patients at high risk for developing febrile neutropenia 
associated with myelotoxic chemotherapy, and for secondary prophylaxis in patients who have 
experienced neutropenia following prior myelotoxic chemotherapy. The Committee noted that a 
single dose of pegfilgrastim (once every two weeks) is an efficacious and safe alternative to daily 
injections of filgrastim. The Committee considered that pegfilgrastim may offer advantages over 
filgrastim in settings where refrigerated storage outside of secondary treatment centers is limited. In 
these settings, patients being treated with filgrastim face longer hospital stays or daily clinic visits and 
this has been associated with lower adherence to treatment and increased risk of life-threatening 
infections. The Committee noted that filgrastim remains a relevant treatment option for patients in 
whom a treatment duration of less than 2 weeks is indicated. 
 

Expert Committee recommendations to include new indications for existing listed cancer and supportive 
medicines: 

− The current listings of cyclophosphamide, cytarabine, dexamethasone, doxorubicin, etoposide, 
ifosfamide, methotrexate, prednisolone and vinblastine on the complementary list of the EML and 
EMLc be extended to include the new indication of anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL). These 
medicines are recognized as part of the standard of care for ALCL. Their benefits and harms were 
accepted as being well established from use in other indications in children and in adults. 

− The current listings of cytarabine, immunoglobulin, mercaptopurine, methotrexate, prednisolone, 
vinblastine and vincristine on the complementary list of the EML and EMLc be extended to include the 
new indication of Langerhans cell histiocytosis (LCH). While LCH is considered a rare disease, the 
Committee acknowledged that treatment is associated with very high survival rates in many cases. 
These medicines are recognized as part of the standard of care for children with LCH. Their benefits 
and harms were accepted as being well established from use in other indications in children and in 
adults. 

− The current listing for rituximab on the complementary list of the EML and EMLc be extended to 
include the new indication of Burkitt lymphoma. The Committee noted that rituximab, when added 
to standard chemotherapy, is associated with meaningful benefits in terms of event-free and overall 
survival in children and adolescents, with a well-known and acceptable safety profile.

The selection and use of essential medicines 2023 
Executive summary of the report of the 24th WHO Expert Committee on the Selection and Use of Essential Medicines 

 

The Expert Committee did not recommend listing for the following new medicines and/or new indications: 
− Cladribine for the treatment of refractory Langerhans cell histiocytosis with involvement of risk organs 

(a high-risk subgroup) in children and adolescents. The Committee noted that cladribine is associated 
with serious haematological toxicities limiting its safe use to specialist tertiary care centres and 
impacting the feasibility of use. 

− Crizotinib for the treatment of relapsed/refractory anaplastic large cell lymphoma in children and 
adolescents because of insufficient evidence and toxicity concerns. 

− Cyclin-dependent kinase 4/6 inhibitors (abemaciclib, palbociclib and ribociclib) for the treatment of 
hormone receptor positive/HER2-negative advanced breast cancer. The Committee acknowledged 
that clinical trial results for this class of medicines in the first- and second-line settings suggest a 
meaningful survival benefit when added to endocrine therapy compared with endocrine therapy 
alone. However, the Committee considered that uncertainties still exist regarding the optimal, most 
active and best tolerated dose, noting that many patients had to reduce the dose in the pivotal trials. 
The Committee also considered that there were uncertainties regarding the duration of treatment, 
positioning as first or second line in the metastatic setting, and whether clinically significant 
differences exist between agents within the pharmacological class. As in 2021, the Committee noted 
the enduring high prices of these medicines, which would pose serious affordability challenges, 
especially in low- and middle-income countries. The Committee recommended that data for these 
medicines continue to be evaluated as they evolve and reiterated the recommendation of the 2021 
Expert Committee that this class of medicines be flagged to the Medicines Patent Pool as potential 
candidates for voluntary licensing agreements. 

− Osimertinib for first-line treatment of EGFR-mutated locally advanced or metastatic non-small cell 
lung cancer (NSCLC). The Committee acknowledged that current data show meaningful survival 
benefits for osimertinib, a third-generation tyrosine kinase inhibitor, compared to first- and second-
generation EML-listed alternatives for this indication (erlotinib, gefitinib and afatinib). However, the 
Committee noted that osimertinib remains very highly priced, and as such would still be unaffordable 
in many low- and middle-income countries. The Committee expressed concern that the inclusion of 
osimertinib on the EML could worsen health inequity by diverting limited resources from less 
expensive alternatives (including generics) already listed on the EML for this indication. The 
Committee requested that data for osimertinib continue to be evaluated as they evolve and 
encouraged efforts to facilitate affordable access to osimertinib in low- and middle-income settings 
e.g., through negotiation of public health licensing agreements through the Medicines Patent Pool.  

− Zanubrutinib for treatment-naïve or relapsed/refractory chronic lymphocytic leukaemia/small 
lymphocytic lymphoma. The Committee noted the results of clinical trials comparing zanubrutinib with 
bendamustine plus rituximab in previously untreated patients, and with ibrutinib in patients with 
relapsed/refractory disease, showed promising survival gains. However, the Committee considered 
that the magnitude of these gains may be limited, and that few long-term data were available. The 
Committee also noted important toxicity concerns (particularly neutropenia). The Committee 
considered that at the current high price, zanubrutinib would neither be considered cost-effective nor 
affordable in most low- and middle-income settings. The Committee considered that substitution of 
ibrutinib with zanubrutinib would not necessarily be associated with health budget savings as 
proposed in the application, because lower ibrutinib doses than those described in the application 
may be used in clinical practice.  

− CD-19-directed antigen receptor (CAR) T-cells (axicabtagene ciloleucel, tisagenlecleucel, lisocabtagene 
maraleucel) for the treatment of adults with relapsed or refractory large B-cell lymphoma. The 

9 



The selection and use of essential medicines 2023 
Executive summary of the report of the 24th WHO Expert Committee on the Selection and Use of Essential Medicines 

 

Committee acknowledged that CAR-T cell treatment outperforms the standard of care with salvage 
immunochemotherapy in terms of progression free-survival, however the survival data remain 
immature. The Committee noted variability across trials (with one study suggesting a potential 
negative effect associated with CAR-T cell therapy) and limited long-term follow-up for all CAR-T 
therapies proposed, making the actual survival benefit uncertain. The Committee noted significant 
safety concerns including cytokine release syndrome and neurological toxicity that can occur in a high 
proportion of patients and which requires highly specialized medical management. The Committee 
recognized that treatment of patients using CAR-T-cell therapy requires dedicated health system 
resources and infrastructure well beyond those available in most settings. CAR-T cell therapy has 
generally been found not to be cost-effective with large budget impacts due to prohibitive production 
costs for administration and management of toxicities. However, the Committee noted with interest 
that these therapies are becoming increasingly available in academic settings and closed/semi-
automated manufacturing process systems are now available which may substantially reduce prices 
and likely increase availability. Recognizing the promising role of CAR-T cell therapy for large B-cell 
lymphoma and potentially also other cancers, the Committee recommended that evidence for these 
therapies, as well as their growing availability and affordability should continue to be monitored by 
WHO.  

− Programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) and programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) immune checkpoint 
inhibitors for the first-line treatment of non-oncogene addicted metastatic NSCLC in patients with 
tumour PD-L1 expression ≥ 50% (pembrolizumab, atezolizumab, cemiplimab) and of non-oncogene 
addicted locally advanced, unresectable NSCLC following chemo-radiotherapy in patients with tumour 
PD-L1 expression ≥1% (durvalumab). As was the case in 2021, the Committee accepted these 
medicines continue to demonstrate a relevant and meaningful survival benefit for eligible patients, 
and possible improvements in quality of life compared with platinum-based chemotherapy. The 
available evidence is particularly strong for pembrolizumab, for which overall survival benefits are 
maintained over 5 years. Atezolizumab and cemiplimab show similar benefits, although the available 
follow-up data are shorter. Similarly, durvalumab data are less mature and will require further 
consideration. The Committee considered that an overall net benefit can be reasonably assumed for 
the entire class when compared to platinum-based chemotherapies. However, more data are needed 
regarding the optimal doses and duration of treatment, with some data already suggesting that for 
several immune checkpoint inhibitors, lower doses and shorter durations may be sufficient. In 
principle, the Committee considered that the availability of several immune checkpoint inhibitors as 
therapeutic options can boost competition and facilitate affordable access. These considerations 
notwithstanding, the Committee noted that prices for immune checkpoint inhibitors remain 
prohibitively high in most settings, and global access to affordable companion diagnostic tests is 
limited. Coupled with the high global prevalence of non-small cell lung cancer, the opportunity costs 
of providing treatment with immune checkpoint inhibitors would be substantial for many health 
systems and would divert limited available resources from other public health programmes. The 
Expert Committee encouraged WHO to continue to work on strategies to address the issue of high 
prices of effective cancer medicines and identify solutions to facilitate increased affordable access. 

− Tislelizumab for the treatment of non-oncogene addicted locally advanced and metastatic NSCLC, 
without patient preselection based on PD-L1 tumour expression. The Committee noted that survival 
data from clinical trials comparing tislelizumab plus chemotherapy versus chemotherapy alone were 
immature, with less than two years of follow-up, and therefore, while promising based on the 
available data, the overall survival benefit was still uncertain. The Committee acknowledged that the 

10 



The selection and use of essential medicines 2023 
Executive summary of the report of the 24th WHO Expert Committee on the Selection and Use of Essential Medicines 

 

reported price of tislelizumab in China (the only country where tislelizumab is currently approved and 
available for this indication) was notably lower than the price of other immune checkpoint inhibitors 
in this setting.  

− Toripalimab for the treatment of locally advanced or metastatic nasopharyngeal and oesophageal 
cancers. The Committee noted that the survival benefit observed when toripalimab is added to 
chemotherapy for first-line treatment of advanced nasopharyngeal cancer was currently modest, and 
that toripalimab had been assigned a score of 3 on the ESMO Magnitude of Clinical Benefit Scale 
(below the accepted score for cancer medicines on the EML). For advanced oesophageal cancer, the 
Committee noted that toripalimab plus chemotherapy compared to chemotherapy alone might 
meaningfully improve survival, however the available evidence was still preliminary with only a short 
follow-up. The Committee acknowledged that the reported price of toripalimab in China (the only 
country where toripalimab is currently approved and available for these indications) was considerably 
lower than other immune checkpoint inhibitors in this setting.  

Section 9: (re-named) Therapeutic foods 
The Expert Committee recommended the inclusion of ready-to-use therapeutic food (RUTF) on the core list of 
the EMLc for the treatment of severe acute malnutrition in children aged 6 months to 5 years based on 
evidence from systematic reviews that demonstrated that the use of RUTF is associated with important 
benefits in terms of nutritional recovery and weight gain compared to standard care. The Committee was 
satisfied with the information provided by the applicants addressing the specific concerns highlighted by the 
2019 Expert Committee regarding potential consequences of including RUTF on the Model List and associated 
risk-mitigation measures. The Committee was also reassured by the publication of Codex Alimentarius 
guidelines which define the nutritional composition, production and labelling standards for RUTF as a food for 
special medical purposes. 

Section 10: Medicines affecting the blood  
Section 10.1 Antianaemia medicines 
The Expert Committee recommended the inclusion of a new strength formulation of ferrous salt + folic acid 
(60 mg elemental iron + 2.8 mg folic acid) on the core list of the EML as a weekly-administered supplement 
for prevention of anaemia in menstruating women and adolescent girls, and for reducing the risk of neural 
tube defect-affected pregnancies. The Committee noted that weekly intermittent supplementation with this 
formulation was associated with similar outcomes as daily iron and folic acid supplementation and is likely to 
be associated with advantages in terms of adherence. The Committee also noted that weekly iron and folic 
acid supplementation is recommended in multiple WHO guidelines. 

Section 10.3 Other medicines for haemoglobinopathies 
The Expert Committee recommended that oral deferasirox be transferred to the core list of the EML and EMLc 
for use in the treatment of transfusional iron overload in patients with thalassaemia syndromes, sickle cell 
disease and other chronic anaemias, with a square box listing specifying oral deferiprone as a therapeutic 
alternative. The Committee also recommended that intravenous deferoxamine should remain listed on the 
complementary list of the EML and EMLc for these indications, and the square box associated with the current 
listing be removed. The Committee accepted that the comparative efficacy and safety of deferiprone, 
deferoxamine and deferasirox were generally similar, and that orally administered treatments may be 
preferred options. The Committee recognized the value in having multiple iron chelating agents included on 
the Model Lists to enable countries to make appropriate national selection decisions taking into consideration 
relevant contextual factors. 

11 



The selection and use of essential medicines 2023 
Executive summary of the report of the 24th WHO Expert Committee on the Selection and Use of Essential Medicines 

 

Section 11: Blood products of human origin and plasma substitutes  
Section 11.1 Blood and blood components 
The Expert Committee recommended the inclusion of pathogen-reduced cryoprecipitate on the core list of 
the EML and EMLc with a square box to indicate non-pathogen-reduced cryoprecipitate as a therapeutic 
alternative. The Committee noted that cryoprecipitate is used to replace coagulation factors in cases of 
massive haemorrhage, von Willebrand disease, and deficiency of coagulation factor XIII. It may also be used 
as an alternative to coagulation factor VIII concentrate in haemophilia A in settings where this is unavailable 
or unaffordable. The Committee also noted that pathogen reduction of cryoprecipitate can reduce the risk of 
transmission of blood-borne infectious agents and has been associated with lower risks of alloimmunization 
and allergic transfusion reactions compared to other blood components. 

Section 11.2.2 Blood coagulation factors 
The Expert Committee did not recommend inclusion of recombinant coagulation factors or bypassing agents 
as therapeutic alternatives to plasma-derived coagulation factors under the square box listings for coagulation 
factors VIII and/or IX on the EML and EMLc. The Committee advised that future consideration for the inclusion 
of these products on the Model Lists will require full applications, compliant with the requirements for EML 
applications and containing all relevant information, so that the available evidence can be evaluated in line 
with standard procedures.  

The Committee recommended that the square box be removed from the current listing of coagulation factor 
VIII, noting that other proposed alternatives (desmopressin and cryoprecipitate) are included in the Model 
Lists as independent listings. The Committee recommended the inclusion of additional strength formulations 
(250 IU and 1000 IU per vial) of factor VIII, acknowledging that these are the most commonly used and 
available formulations.  

The Committee agreed that coagulation factor IX complex is a suitable therapeutic alternative to coagulation 
factor IX in situations where purified factor IX is not available. The Committee therefore recommended that 
coagulation factor IX complex be included as a therapeutic alternative under the current square box listing for 
factor IX.  

The Committee did not recommend removal of dextran from the Model Lists. While it is not used in the 
treatment of haemophilia, it remains an essential plasma substitute for patients in need of blood volume 
replacement.  

Section 12: Cardiovascular medicines  
Section 12.5.1 Anti-platelet medicines 
The Expert Committee did not recommend the addition of ticagrelor to the core list of the EML for the 
prevention of atherothrombotic events in adults with acute coronary syndromes or high-risk patients with a 
history of myocardial infarction. The Committee considered that there was uncertainty in efficacy outcomes 
across trials comparing ticagrelor and clopidogrel and among different patient sub-populations. The 
Committee also noted that ticagrelor was associated with significantly increased risks of some important 
bleeding outcomes (e.g., fatal intracranial bleeding). Further, while it was noted that while generics of 
ticagrelor are available, it remains more expensive than clopidogrel in many settings. 

Section 12.7 (new sub-section) Fixed-dose combinations for prevention of atherosclerotic 
cardiovascular disease  
The Committee recommended the inclusion of three fixed-dose combinations of cardiovascular medicines 
(acetylsalicylic acid + simvastatin + ramipril + atenolol + hydrochlorothiazide; acetylsalicylic acid + atorvastatin 

12 



The selection and use of essential medicines 2023 
Executive summary of the report of the 24th WHO Expert Committee on the Selection and Use of Essential Medicines 

 

+ ramipril; atorvastatin + perindopril + amlodipine) on the core list of the EML for use in primary and secondary 
prevention of atherosclerotic cardiovascular diseases. Components of the combinations are listed with a 
square box, indicating other medicines within the respective pharmacological classes represent therapeutic 
alternatives, consistent with the current square box listings for hydrochlorothiazide, antihypertensives and 
statins. The Committee noted evidence from large randomized-controlled trials that indicate that use of these 
combinations is associated with reduced risks of cardiovascular events, including fatal and non-fatal 
myocardial infarction and stroke and the need for revascularization in primary and secondary prevention 
settings. The Committee also noted data that indicates that the combination products are associated with 
improved adherence and quality of life, at prices equal to or lower than multiple component monotherapies. 
This recommendation notwithstanding, the Committee emphasized that the ongoing availability of single 
agent cardiovascular medicines was critical to allow treatment modification where necessary, and that 
combination products should not displace single components at country level. The Committee further 
considered that guidance concerning the most appropriate use of these FDCs for different indications should 
be provided in separate WHO guidance documents.  

Section 13: Dermatological medicines  
The Expert Committee did not recommend the inclusion of sunscreen on the EML and EMLc for the prevention 
of skin cancer in people with albinism or xeroderma pigmentosum. The Committee acknowledged the public 
health relevance and effectiveness of sunscreen in preventing skin cancer especially in high-risk subgroups 
such people with albinism or xeroderma pigmentosum, but also in the general population. The Committee 
agreed that the use of sunscreens, as well as other sun-protection and sun-avoidance strategies and behaviors 
are important, effective preventive interventions to reduce the incidence and prevalence of skin cancers, 
including melanoma. The Committee also noted that the global burden of disease of such cancers is increasing, 
and that their treatment is associated with considerable costs for both individuals and health systems.  

The Committee considered that before being able to recommend sunscreen products for inclusion on the 
Model Lists, it would be necessary to define relevant standards and specifications for therapeutic (as distinct 
from cosmetic) sunscreen products protecting against both UVA and UVB rays (i.e. broad spectrum). This 
would include details of specific active ingredients and their concentration, and the range of sun protection 
factor rating. This information needs to be supported by evidence and implications for labelling standards, to 
provide clear and reliable guidance for countries for selection of the most appropriate sunscreen products. 

Section 13.4 Medicines affecting skin differentiation and proliferation 
The Expert Committee acknowledged the global burden of psoriasis and the public health need for effective 
treatments. Until now, only topical therapies for psoriasis have been included on the Model Lists. The 
Committee recommended the inclusion of methotrexate on the complementary list of the EML and EMLc for 
the new indication of psoriasis, based on a favourable balance of desirable to undesirable effects. The 
Committee did not recommend the inclusion of ustekinumab on the EML for the treatment of severe psoriasis 
in adults. The Committee recognized the important role of biological disease-modifying agents in the 
management of moderate to severe psoriasis. The Committee requested that a comprehensive review of all 
biological disease-modifying medicines in the treatment of moderate to severe forms of psoriasis be 
undertaken to inform future consideration for EML and EMLc listing. 

Section 18: Medicines for endocrine disorders  
The Expert Committee did not recommend inclusion of the vitamin D analogues alfacalcidol and calcitriol on 
the complementary list of the EML and EMLc, for the proposed indications of hypoparathyroidism, 

13 



The selection and use of essential medicines 2023 
Executive summary of the report of the 24th WHO Expert Committee on the Selection and Use of Essential Medicines 

 

hypophosphataemic rickets, hypocalcaemic vitamin D dependent/resistant rickets, neonatal hypocalcaemia, 
chronic kidney disease, and other disorders of vitamin D metabolism or transport. While the application 
included reference to conditional guideline recommendations for the use of vitamin D analogues in chronic 
kidney disease, hypophosphataemic rickets and hypoparathyroidism, overall, the Committee noted that 
evidence base was uncertain due to risk of bias, indirectness when assessing patient-important outcomes, 
inconsistencies, and imprecision. The Committee considered that the limited likelihood of influencing 
important clinical outcomes was potentially outweighed by the risks associated with the use of alfacalcidol 
and calcitriol, such as hypercalciuria, decrease in renal function and cardiovascular risk. 

The Expert Committee did not recommend the inclusion of phosphorus on the complementary list of the EMLc, 
for the treatment of hypophosphataemic rickets in children. The Committee noted evidence from small cohort 
studies which suggests that early introduction of treatment with phosphorus and vitamin D in children with 
hypophosphataemic rickets has beneficial effects in terms of growth, improved bone mineralization and 
reduced bone deformities. However, the Committee considered that hypophosphataemic rickets is a relatively 
rare condition which constitutes only a small sub-group of all hypophosphataemic conditions that may benefit 
from phosphorus supplementation. The Committee therefore considered that a comprehensive review of the 
evidence for phosphorus treatment across all conditions for which it is indicated should be requested for 
future consideration.  

The Expert Committee did not recommend inclusion of zoledronic acid on the EML and EMLc for the new 
indication of osteogenesis imperfecta. The Committee noted that available evidence suggests that 
bisphosphonates may increase bone mineral density but considered that the benefits of bisphosphonate 
treatment on other important outcomes such as fracture risk, bone pain and physical functioning were 
unclear.  

The Expert Committee did not recommend inclusion of ketoconazole on the EML for the treatment of Cushing 
syndrome. The Committee noted that the available evidence suggests that a significant proportion of patients 
have a good response to treatment with ketoconazole, however, the certainty of evidence was low, and there 
are serious concerns about the safety profile associated with systemic use of ketoconazole, including 
potentially severe liver toxicity, and the potential for numerous drug-drug interactions. 

The Expert Committee did not recommend inclusion of glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RAs) 
to the core list of the EML for weight loss in obesity because of uncertain long-term clinical benefit and safety 
in this patient population. The Committee noted that GLP-1 RAs have been shown to reduce weight and body 
mass index in the short-term compared to placebo. However, data are lacking on long-term effectiveness, 
optimal duration of treatment, maintenance of weight reduction once the therapy is stopped, and effect on 
other clinically important outcomes (e.g. hypertension or hyperglycaemia). Long-term safety data are also 
lacking.  

Section 18.3 Estrogens 
The Expert Committee did not recommend inclusion of 17-ß-estradiol on the complementary list of the EML 
for the management of pubertal development in adolescents with primary or secondary ovarian failure. The 
Committee considered that the application reported insufficient information on the evidence supporting the 
use of estradiol for the proposed indication, including optimal dosages and formulations. The Committee 
noted that global prevalence of primary ovarian failure or primary ovarian insufficiency varies among different 
populations but is generally low. The Committee considered that re-evaluation of estradiol should be made 

14 



The selection and use of essential medicines 2023 
Executive summary of the report of the 24th WHO Expert Committee on the Selection and Use of Essential Medicines 

 

considering additional indications for which estradiol is routinely used, such as hormone replacement therapy 
in menopause or following hysterectomy. 

Section 18.5.1 Insulins 
The Expert Committee recommended that the current listings for human insulin on the core list of the EML 
and EMLc be extended to include cartridge and pre-filled pen delivery systems. The Committee considered 
that cartridges and pre-filled pens may offer advantages for patients over vials and syringes in terms of ease 
of use, greater accuracy of dosing and improved adherence. The Committee acknowledged that affordable 
access to insulin products remains a critical global health priority.  

Section 18.6 Medicines for hypoglycaemia 
The Expert Committee did not recommend the inclusion of somatropin on the complementary list of the EMLc 
for the management of hypoglycaemia secondary to growth hormone deficiency in neonates, infants and 
young children. The Committee acknowledged that the management of hypoglycaemia, of any etiology, in 
neonates and infants is critical to prevent permanent neurological sequelae. However, the Committee 
considered that comparative evidence for somatropin versus other medicines for management of 
hypoglycaemia currently included on the Model Lists (e.g. diazoxide, glucagon, glucose) and information 
regarding the comparative costs and cost-effectiveness would be necessary to inform any future consideration 
for somatropin in this indication. 

Section 18.8 (new sub-section) Medicines for disorders of the pituitary hormone system  
The Expert Committee recommended the inclusion of cabergoline on the core list of the EML for the medical 
management of hyperprolactinaemia associated with prolactin-secreting pituitary adenomas (prolactinomas). 
Listing was recommended with bromocriptine as a therapeutic alternative under a square box listing. Overall, 
the Committee considered that the available evidence suggests medical therapy with dopamine agonists can 
achieve prolactin normalization in most patients. The Committee noted that dopamine agonist therapy is a 
preferred first-line intervention for management of hyperprolactinaemia and prolactinomas and may be the 
only option in settings where specialist neurosurgery is not available, or in patients for whom surgery is not 
feasible. Listing was recommended with bromocriptine as therapeutic alternative under a square box listing. 
Cabergoline may be superior to bromocriptine in decreasing the serum prolactin concentration and has fewer 
adverse effects but is usually more costly. 

The Expert Committee recommended the inclusion of octreotide immediate-release and modified-release 
injections on the complementary list of the EML for use in the management of gigantism and acromegaly in 
adults with growth hormone-producing tumours. The Committee noted that transsphenoidal surgery is the 
treatment of first choice for this condition but accepted that pharmacological treatment with somatostatin 
analogues is an effective alternative in situations where surgery is not possible or available. The Committee 
did not recommend the inclusion of lanreotide depot injection either as an individual listing or as a therapeutic 
alternative to octreotide, because it was not shown to be superior to octreotide, is more expensive, and unlike 
octreotide, is not yet available as generics.  

Section 19: Immunologicals  
Section 19.3 Vaccines 
This section was reviewed by the Secretariat for consistency and full alignment with the latest WHO 
recommendations for routine immunization (March 2023). No changes to the current vaccine listings on the 
EML and EMLc were required.

The selection and use of essential medicines 2023 
Executive summary of the report of the 24th WHO Expert Committee on the Selection and Use of Essential Medicines 

 

Section 21: Ophthalmological preparations  
The Expert Committee did not recommend inclusion of hypromellose on the EML and EMLc for the treatment 
of dry eye disease in adults and children. The Committee accepted that hypromellose is a safe and effective 
ocular surface lubricant for reducing the signs and symptoms of dry eyes, especially for patients with mild to 
moderate symptoms. However, the Committee considered that the sight-threatening complications of dry eye 
disease are primarily associated with severe forms of the condition. There was limited evidence comparing 
hypromellose versus other artificial tear preparations, including combinations, for improvement in relevant 
clinical outcomes, specifically in patients with severe dry eye disease.  

Section 22: Medicines for reproductive health and perinatal care 
Section 22.2 Ovulation inducers 
The Expert Committee recommended inclusion of letrozole on the complementary list of the EML for the 
treatment of anovulatory infertility associated with polycystic ovary syndrome or unexplained infertility. 
Listing was recommended with anastrozole as a therapeutic alternative under a square box listing. The 
Committee noted evidence that letrozole is associated with a moderate increase in live births and clinical 
pregnancies compared to clomifene (a medicine currently included in the EML) in patients with infertility due 
to polycystic ovary syndrome, and similar efficacy to clomifene for live births or biochemically tested 
pregnancy in couples with unexplained infertility. The Committee noted that WHO guidelines for the 
prevention, diagnosis and treatment of infertility are in development, and are expected to include 
recommendations for use of letrozole for ovulation induction in these populations.  

Section 22.3 Uterotonics 
The Committee recommended that the current listing of mifepristone + misoprostol on the core list of the 
EML be extended to include the new indication of medical management of intra-uterine fetal demise. The 
Committee noted evidence that the combination regimen was associated with higher rates of expulsion and 
shorter expulsion times than misoprostol alone. The Committee considered that adverse effects associated 
with use of the combination were generally mild, well-known and manageable. The Committee also noted 
that the medical management of intra-uterine fetal demise using this combination regimen has been included 
in WHO guidelines for medical management of abortion since 2018. 

Section 24: Medicines for mental and behavioural disorders 
A total of 16 applications for medicines for mental health conditions and substance use disorders were 
considered by the Expert Committee. Many were developed by, or in consultation with the WHO Department 
of Mental Health and Substance Use with the goal of optimizing alignment between the Model Lists and 
recommendations in relevant WHO guidelines. 

Section 24.1 Medicines used in psychotic disorders 
The Expert Committee recommended the removal of chlorpromazine immediate-release injection from the 
core list of the EML for the treatment of schizophrenia and related psychoses because of a lack of high-quality 
evidence of benefit versus either placebo, or the alternative EML-listed haloperidol immediate-release 
injection, with a likely increased risk of adverse effects. The Committee recommended inclusion of olanzapine 
immediate-release injection on the core list of the EML for the acute treatment of schizophrenia and related 
psychoses based on evidence of similar effectiveness and greater tolerability compared to haloperidol 
immediate-release injection. 

The Expert Committee did not recommend inclusion of paliperidone palmitate 3-month long-acting injection 
on the EML for maintenance treatment of schizophrenia. The Committee noted that compared to the 1-month 

16 



The selection and use of essential medicines 2023 
Executive summary of the report of the 24th WHO Expert Committee on the Selection and Use of Essential Medicines 

 

formulation, the 3-month formulation has evidence of similar clinical efficacy and safety and may offer 
advantages to patients in terms of fewer injections. However, the Committee noted that it is not 
recommended to initiate treatment with the 3-month formulation, rather it is used in patients who 
demonstrate benefit and tolerance to the 1-month formulation over at least 4 months. In addition, the 3-
month formulation is more highly priced, not yet available as generic, and currently has limited availability in 
low- and middle-income countries.  

The Expert Committee recommended the addition of a square box to the listing of risperidone on the EML for 
treatment of schizophrenia and related chronic psychotic disorders, specifying oral aripiprazole, olanzapine, 
paliperidone and quetiapine as therapeutic alternatives. The Committee noted that evidence from several 
high-quality meta-analyses on the acute and maintenance treatment of schizophrenia and other chronic 
psychoses that found most oral second-generation antipsychotics were similarly effective and tolerable.  

The Expert Committee recalled the request made by the 2021 Committee that therapeutic alternatives for the 
square box listings for chlorpromazine, fluphenazine and haloperidol in this section of the EML be reviewed. 
The Expert Committee accepted the rationale applied by the WHO Department of Mental Health and 
Substance Use in identifying suitable therapeutic alternatives, and made the following recommendations: 

− Chlorpromazine (oral formulations only) be included as a therapeutic alternative to oral haloperidol. 
(This recommendation, coupled with the recommendation above to remove chlorpromazine injection, 
effectively removes the independent listing for chlorpromazine from the EML).  

− Haloperidol decanoate and zuclopenthixol decanoate be included as therapeutic alternatives to 
fluphenazine (decanoate/enantate). 

The Expert Committee recommended the deletion of chlorpromazine and haloperidol (all dosage forms) from 
the complementary list of the EMLc. The Committee noted that schizophrenia and other chronic psychotic 
disorders are rare in children younger than 12 years. The Committee agreed that the available evidence for 
these medicines in the treatment of psychoses in children was inconclusive and insufficient to support their 
ongoing inclusion on the EMLc. 

Section 24.2.1 Medicines used in depressive disorders 
The Expert Committee recommended that square box should be removed from the current listing for 
amitriptyline for the treatment of depressive disorders on the EML. The Committee considered that there are 
insufficient data to support the inclusion of other tricyclic antidepressants as therapeutic alternatives for 
amitriptyline. The Committee considered that amitriptyline is the tricyclic antidepressant with the larger 
evidence base and other molecules have insufficient evidence, or are likely to be inferior to amitriptyline in 
some relevant dimension (e.g., clomipramine is likely to be less acceptable to patients than amitriptyline and 
placebo). 

The Expert Committee recommended the deletion of fluoxetine for the treatment of depressive disorders in 
children from the complementary list of the EMLc. The Committee accepted that fluoxetine may be used in 
children younger than 12 years in some setting where there is limited access to mental health facilities and 
non-pharmacological interventions and may be recommended in some consensus guidelines. However, the 
Committee noted that the reported prevalence of depression in children younger than 12 years is low and 
considered that the current evidence for use of fluoxetine in this age group was inconclusive and insufficient 
to support its ongoing inclusion the EMLc. This recommendation therefore also applies to the listing of 
fluoxetine on the EMLc in Section 2.3 Medicines for other common symptoms in palliative care. The 
Committee noted that the prevalence of depression substantially increases throughout adolescence and into 

17 



The selection and use of essential medicines 2023 
Executive summary of the report of the 24th WHO Expert Committee on the Selection and Use of Essential Medicines 

 

adulthood and confirmed that fluoxetine will remain included on the EML for the treatment of depression in 
adults. 

The Expert Committee did not recommend the inclusion of phenelzine on the complementary list of the EML 
for use in treatment-resistant depression because of uncertain evidence for benefit in the proposed patient 
population, and increased risk of harms. The Committee noted that the systematic reviews and meta-analyses 
presented in the application which evaluated the comparative efficacy of phenelzine versus placebo or other 
antidepressants did not include participants with treatment-resistant depression. The Committee also noted 
that phenelzine is associated with potentially serious adverse effects and has high potential for drug-drug and 
drug-food interactions. Treatment with phenelzine therefore would require careful and specialized monitoring 
and management, which may not be available in many low- and middle-income settings.  

Section 24.2.2 Medicines used in bipolar disorders 
The Expert Committee recommended the inclusion of quetiapine, with a square box indicating aripiprazole, 
olanzapine and paliperidone as specified therapeutic alternatives, on the core list of the EML for treatment of 
bipolar disorders. The Committee considered that the evidence presented in the application demonstrated 
the effectiveness of the proposed second-generation antipsychotics in the acute treatment and long-term 
prevention of mania/hypomania and/or depression in bipolar disorders was similar to that of classic mood 
stabilizers currently included on the EML (carbamazepine, lithium carbonate and valproic acid). All proposed 
medicines were shown to be either superior or non-inferior to placebo for acceptability (determined by all-
cause discontinuations). The Committee agreed that second-generation antipsychotics have an important role 
in bipolar disorders in patients who do not adequately respond to or experience adverse events from mood 
stabilizers. Moreover, the Committee noted that the two classes of medicines may be used in combination in 
selected patients in clinical practice. 

Section 24.3 Medicines for anxiety disorders 
The Expert Committee recommended the addition of a note to the listing of diazepam in this section of the 
EML to indicate use is only recommended for the short-term emergency management of acute and severe 
anxiety symptoms as the balance of benefits and risks of diazepam use under these circumstances is 
considered favourable. The Committee also recommended that lorazepam should be specified as the only 
therapeutic alternative under the square box listing for diazepam for this indication. These recommendations 
are aligned with expected recommendations in updated mhGAP guidelines. 

The Expert Committee recommended the inclusion of fluoxetine on the EML for the new indications of use in 
generalized anxiety disorder, panic disorder, and social anxiety disorder. Listing is recommended with a square 
box specifying citalopram, escitalopram, fluvoxamine, paroxetine, and sertraline as therapeutic alternatives. 
The Committee considered that the evidence presented in the application supported the use of fluoxetine and 
the proposed alternative selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) for these indications as they were 
shown to be more effective than placebo in reducing anxiety symptoms and have a well-known and acceptable 
safety profile. 

Section 24.4 Medicines used for obsessive compulsive disorders 
The Expert Committee recommended the inclusion of fluoxetine on the EML for the new indication of 
obsessive-compulsive disorder in adults. Listing is recommended with a square box specifying citalopram, 
escitalopram, fluvoxamine, paroxetine, and sertraline as therapeutic alternatives. The Committee considered 
that the evidence presented in the application supported the use of fluoxetine and the proposed alternative 

18 



The selection and use of essential medicines 2023 
Executive summary of the report of the 24th WHO Expert Committee on the Selection and Use of Essential Medicines 

 

SSRIs for the treatment of obsessive-compulsive disorder, indicating that SSRIs are more effective than 
placebo in reducing obsessive-compulsive symptoms, and have a more favourable safety profile than tricyclic 
antidepressants. 

Section 24.5 Medicines for disorders due to psychoactive substance use 
This section of the Model Lists has been updated to include separate sub-sections for medicines for alcohol, 
nicotine and opioid use disorders. 

Section 24.5.1 (new sub-section) Medicines for alcohol use disorders  
The Expert Committee recommended the inclusion of acamprosate and naltrexone on the core list of the EML 
for the treatment of alcohol use disorder in adults. The Committee considered that the available evidence 
showed these medicines to be associated with moderate improvements in abstinence rates, which would 
translate to meaningful impact at the population level. Both medicines are generally well tolerated and are 
recommended in WHO guidelines. The Committee considered that the availability of different medicines for 
alcohol use disorder would provide valuable options and choice for patients and clinicians, and could facilitate 
increased market competition, reduce costs and improve affordable access for national health systems.  

Section 24.5.2 (new sub-section) Medicines for nicotine use disorders  
The Expert Committee recommended the inclusion of nicotine lozenges and mouth spray on the core list of 
the EML as additional forms of nicotine replacement therapy for tobacco and smoking cessation. The 
Committee noted high-quality evidence from multiple randomized controlled trials that all licensed forms of 
nicotine replacement therapy are effective at increasing increase cessation rates. The Committee considered 
that the availability of different forms of nicotine replacement therapy would provide options and choice for 
patients and clinicians, and could facilitate increased market competition, reduce costs and improve 
affordable access for national health systems. 

Section 29: Medicines for diseases of joints  
Section 29.3 Juvenile joint diseases 
The Expert Committee recommended the inclusion of triamcinolone hexacetonide on the complementary list 
of the EML and EMLc for use in the treatment of juvenile idiopathic arthritis. Listing is recommended with a 
square box to indicate triamcinolone acetonide as a therapeutic alternative for national selection in situations 
where triamcinolone hexacetonide is not available. The Committee noted that the evidence indicates that 
triamcinolone hexacetonide is superior to triamcinolone acetate in terms of efficacy and duration of response 
but has been subject to availability and supply shortages worldwide. As was the case in 2021, the Committee 
considered that the available evidence was still limited, and of sub-optimal quality, but accepted that use of 
intra-articular glucocorticoid injections with triamcinolone (hexacetonide, and to a lesser extent acetonide) 
may be associated with improvements in joint inflammation in oligoarticular forms of juvenile idiopathic 
arthritis and have advantages over long-term systemic corticosteroid use in terms of harms.  

The Expert Committee did not recommend the inclusion of anakinra for treatment of systemic onset juvenile 
idiopathic arthritis (SOJIA) with macrophage activation syndrome (MAS), nor of tocilizumab for treatment of 
SOJIA on the EML and EMLc. As was the case when these medicines were considered in 2021, the Expert 
Committee considered that the clinical benefits and safety of these medicines (including risk of infection) 
remain uncertain based on the limited available evidence. The Committee also considered that the feasibility 
of use of these medicines, particularly in low-resource settings was unlikely given their current high prices, 
and requirements for specialized care and monitoring and management of adverse events.

The selection and use of essential medicines 2023 
Executive summary of the report of the 24th WHO Expert Committee on the Selection and Use of Essential Medicines 

 

Section 30: (re-named) Dental medicines and preparations  
The Expert Committee recalled the request made by the 2021 Committee for WHO to identify the alternative 
fluoride-containing formulations recommended for use in the prevention of dental caries in order that they 
be clearly defined in the Model Lists to provide clear guidance to countries. The Committee considered that 
the evidence presented in the applications for fluoride gel, mouthrinse and varnish supported the 
effectiveness and safety of these products in the prevention of dental caries, and therefore recommended 
their inclusion on the core list of the EML and EMLc, as specific fluoride-containing formulations. 

The Committee also recommended the inclusion of resin-based composites on the core list of the EML and 
EMLc for use as dental sealants (low-viscosity forms) and as filling materials (high-viscosity forms) in the 
prevention and treatment of dental caries. The Committee noted that these products are effective and safe 
and have functional and aesthetic advantages compared to glass ionomer cement, however they require more 
specialized expertise and facilities for application. The Committee noted that the availability of effective 
alternatives to dental amalgam is important to enable parties to the Minamata Convention on Mercury to 
achieve the mandated phase-down of dental amalgam use, decreasing environmental mercury pollution.

Executive summary of the report of the 24th WHO Expert Committee on the Selection and Use of Essential Medicines 

 

Other matters considered by the Expert Committee 
Age-appropriateness of formulations of essential medicines for children  
In consideration of the review of the age-appropriateness of formulations of medicines on the EMLc, and the 
comparison report of the EML versus EMLc, the Expert Committee recommended changes to the EMLc for 
addition of new, age-appropriate formulations and strengths of existing essential medicines, deletion of 
unavailable or age-inappropriate formulations and strengths, and other listing modifications as proposed in 
the application. The Committee also endorsed the proposals for further review of the public health relevance 
and evidence of specific medicines for use in children for potential future consideration for inclusion on the 
EMLc. The Committee noted and welcomed the ongoing review being coordinated by the Secretariat for the 
remaining sections of the EMLc for consideration by the 2025 Expert Committee. 

Off-label use of medicines 
The Expert Committee noted the comments received from the International Federation of Pharmaceutical 
Manufacturers and Associations (IFPMA) regarding off-label use of medicines included on the Model Lists. The 
Committee reiterated the views expressed by the 2015 Expert Committee regarding consideration of 
medicines for inclusion on the Model Lists for off-label uses or indications. Namely, that labelling is the 
responsibility of national regulatory authorities, and there may consequently be different labels for the same 
product in different countries, and that there is thus no global standard for what is considered “off-label”. 
Furthermore, updating approved labels for older products may not be pursued by market authorization 
holder(s) if doing so it is not determined to be commercially viable, and that there are many examples of older 
products whose regulatory labels are inconsistent with current clinical evidence and current clinical practice. 
Consequently, the Expert Committee reaffirmed that off-label status of a medicine need not be a reason to 
exclude it from the Model Lists if it otherwise meets the criteria for inclusion. Because of the intended global 
audience of the Model Lists and the differences in national regulatory labeling, the Committee recommended 
that off-label status should not be specifically marked in the Model Lists. The Committee recognized that it is 
a responsibility of relevant national decision-makers to consider national labeling and legal requirements in 
the selection and use of medicines at the country level. The Committee considered that the inclusion on the 
Model Lists of those off-label medicines that are associated with relevant clinical benefits and financial 
advantages can play an important role in informing national selection and facilitating progress towards 
universal health coverage.  

Rare diseases 
Medicines to treat rare diseases have been included on the Model Lists since the first EML was published in 
1977. The Expert Committee acknowledged that rare diseases comprise a diverse group of conditions that 
individually, affect a small portion of the population. However, collectively, they can affect millions of people 
worldwide. There is no universally agreed definition of ‘rare’, with prevalence-based national and regional 
definitions of rare diseases (often in the context of orphan medicine legislation) varying considerably. 
Furthermore, a disease may be considered rare in one population or setting, while being highly prevalent in 
another, as disease prevalence can vary depending on various population-specific, environmental and 
geographic factors. The Committee also noted that with increasing advancements in precision medicine and 
targeted treatments in some areas (e.g., oncology), small/rare sub-categories of otherwise more common 
diseases are emerging. The Committee noted that many, but not all medicines for rare diseases are highly 
priced and may be unaffordable for many patients and healthcare systems, particularly in low-resource 
settings. 

21 



The selection and use of essential medicines 2023 
Executive summary of the report of the 24th WHO Expert Committee on the Selection and Use of Essential Medicines 

 

The Expert Committee recognized the role of the Model Lists in providing an evidence-based blueprint to 
inform decision-making for national essential medicines lists, including selection of medicines for rare 
diseases. The Committee also recognized the important advocacy role that inclusion on the Model Lists can 
play in fostering further actions that can lead to increased access and affordability of essential medicines for 
rare diseases. The Committee considered that the low prevalence of a disease need not be a reason to exclude 
medicines for its treatment from the Model Lists if they otherwise meet the criteria for inclusion.  

Procedures for updating the WHO Model Lists  
The Expert Committee noted that the procedure for updating the Model Lists has only been updated once 
since the publication of the first EML in 1977. The Committee also took note of the fact that since the revised 
procedures were introduced in 2001 (as outlined in Executive Board document EB109/8) the medicine 
evaluation landscape has become increasingly complex and that some aspects of the procedure may benefit 
from revision. Issues that were discussed by the Committee and can be considered as part of a broader 
discussion with Member States are: the actual application process, including how to balance the quality of the 
applications against the openness of the process that accepts applications without filtering them for quality, 
the issues surrounding effective but highly priced medicines which pose difficulties as feasibility and 
acceptability could be low, the role of products commonly not classified as medicines on the list such as 
condoms, oxygen and toothpastes, the role of the Model Lists in those clinical areas where WHO does not 
have guidelines, the dissemination of the Model Lists and the role with national lists to facilitate progress 
towards universal health coverage, and the role of the Model Lists in the context of public health emergencies 
of international concern. The Committee therefore recommended WHO to consider initiating a process to 
reassess the procedure for updating WHO's Model Lists of Essential Medicines. This should be an inclusive 
collaboration with Member States and other relevant stakeholders, including for example other UN 
organizations, WHO Collaborating Centres, universities and scientific societies, international procurement 
agencies, non-governmental organizations, professional associations, national essential medicines 
programme representatives, representatives from the pharmaceutical industry, and patients’ organizations.
